<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>In modern times the tendency of the inhabitants of a country to
dwell together in large communities, and the consequent need for
accumulating in a particular locality a sufficient supply of water for
household, social, and industrial purposes, have rendered necessary the
construction of such engineering works as impounding reservoirs and
wells, by means of which the abundant measure of sparsely populated
districts may be utilized, and water obtained not only free from those
impurities which it collects in densely populated districts, but also
in greater quantity than the natural sources of the district are
capable of supplying.</p>

<p>Of the works mentioned, wells have fairly a primary claim upon the
notice of the sanitary engineer, for, without undervaluing other
sources of supply, the water from them certainly possesses the
advantage over that from rivers and surface drainage, of being without
organic admixture and unimpregnated with those deadly spores which find
their way into surface waters and are so fatal in seasons of epidemic
visitation. A great deal of the irregularity in the action of wells,
and the consequent distrust with which they are regarded by many, is
attributable either to improper situation or to the haphazard manner
in which the search for underground water is frequently conducted. As
regards the first cause, it cannot be too strongly stated that extreme
caution is necessary in the choice of situations for wells, and that a
sound geological knowledge of the country in which the attempt is to be
made should precede any sinking or boring for this purpose, otherwise
much useless expense may be incurred without a chance of success.
Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span> the power of indicating those points where wells may, in all
probability, be successfully established, is one of the chief practical
applications of geology to the useful purposes of life.</p>

<p>Two cases in point are before me as I write; in the one 15,000<i>l.</i> has
been spent in sinking a shaft and driving headings which yield but
little water, found abundantly at the same depth in a mine adjoining;
and in the other a town would be, but for its surface wells, entirely
without water, the waterworks having been idle for weeks, and the
sinkers are feebly endeavouring to obtain water by deep sinkings, in a
position where its occurrence in any quantity is physically impossible.
Ample supplies could be obtained in both these cases by shifting the
situation a few hundred yards.</p>

<p>The subject-matter of the following pages is divided into chapters
which treat of geological considerations, the new red sandstone, well
sinking, well boring, the American tube well, well boring at great
depths, and examples of wells executed and of localities supplied
respectively, with tables and miscellaneous information. Each system
with its adjuncts has been kept complete in itself, instead of
separating the various tools and appliances into classes, the plan
adopted in the most approved French and German technical works. This,
however, when too rigidly adhered to, as is the case with German works
in particular, renders it troublesome for even a practised engineer to
grasp a strange system in its entirety, while the pupil is wearied and
retarded in his reading by an over-elaborate classification.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be remarked that undue prominence has been given to
the tertiary and cretaceous formations, but it is urged in extenuation
that they happen to underlie two of the most important cities in
Europe, and that they have, in consequence, received a more thorough
investigation than has been accorded to other districts. The records
of wells in many formations are singularly scanty and unreliable, but
it is hoped that the time is not far distant when the water-bearing
characteristics of strata, such as the new red sandstone and permian,
will receive proper attention, and that correct official records of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
well-work will be found in every locality, as this alone can rescue an
important branch of hydraulic engineering from the charge of empiricism.</p>

<p>In the course of the work the writings of G. R. Burnell, C.E., Baldwin
Latham, C.E., M. Dru, Emerson Bainbridge, C.E., G. C. Greenwell, and
other well known authorities, have been freely referred to, particular
recourse having been had to the works of Professor Prestwich, F.G.S.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Geo. G. Andr&eacute;, C.E., F.G.S., Messrs. S. Baker and Son,
and Messrs. T. Docwra and Son, for many suggestions and much valuable
information; to Messrs. Docwra special thanks are due for some of the
important sections illustrating chapter vii.</p>

<p>Any claim to attention the book may deserve is based upon its being an
attempt to embody, in a collected form, facts and information derived
from practice, or from various sources not accessible to the majority
of those engaged in the superintendence, or otherwise interested in the
construction of wells.</p>

<span class="small">GEOLOGICAL
CONSIDERATIONS.</span></h2>

<p>Nearly every civil engineer is familiar with the fact that certain
porous soils, such as sand or gravel, absorb water with rapidity, and
that the ground composed of them soon dries up after showers. If a well
be sunk in such soils, we often penetrate to considerable depths before
we meet with water; but this is usually found on our approaching some
lower part of the porous formation where it rests on an impervious
bed; for here the water, unable to make its way downwards in a direct
line, accumulates as in a reservoir, and is ready to ooze out into
any opening which may be made, in the same manner as we see the salt
water filtrate into and fill any hollow which we dig in the sands of
the shore at low tide. A spring, then, is the lowest point or lip
of an underground reservoir of water in the stratification. A well,
therefore, sunk in such strata will most probably furnish, besides the
volume of the spring, an additional supply of water.</p>

<p>The transmission of water through a porous medium being so rapid, we
may easily understand why springs are thrown out on the side of a
hill, where the upper set of strata consist of chalk, sand, and other
permeable substances, whilst those lying beneath are composed of clay
or other retentive soils. The only difficulty, indeed, is to explain
why the water does not ooze out everywhere along the line of junction
of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> formations, so as to form one continuous land-soak, instead
of a few springs only, and these oftentimes far distant from each
other. The principal cause of such a concentration of the waters at
a few points is, first, the existence of inequalities in the upper
surface of the impermeable stratum, which lead the water, as valleys
do on the external surface of a country, into certain low levels and
channels; and secondly, the frequency of rents and fissures, which act
as natural drains. That the generality of springs owe their supply to
the atmosphere is evident from this, that they vary in the different
seasons of the year, becoming languid or entirely ceasing to flow after
long droughts, and being again replenished after a continuance of rain.
Many of them are probably indebted for the constancy and uniformity
of their volume to the great extent of the subterranean reservoirs
with which they communicate, and the time required for these to empty
themselves by percolation. Such a gradual and regulated discharge is
exhibited, though in a less perfect degree, in all great lakes, for
these are not sensibly affected in their levels by a sudden shower,
but are only slightly raised, and their channels of efflux, instead of
being swollen suddenly like the bed of a torrent, carry off the surplus
water gradually.</p>

<p>An Artesian well, so called from the province of Artois, in France, is
a shaft sunk or bored through impermeable strata, until a water-bearing
stratum is tapped, when the water is forced upwards by the hydrostatic
pressure due to the superior level at which the rain-water was received.</p>

<p>Among the causes of the failure of Artesian wells, we may mention
those numerous rents and faults which abound in some rocks, and the
deep ravines and valleys by which many countries are traversed; for
when these natural lines of drainage exist, there remains only a small
quantity of water to escape by artificial issues. We are also liable
to be baffled by the great thickness either of porous or impervious
strata, or by the dip of the beds, which may carry off the waters from
adjoining high lands to some trough in an opposite direction,&mdash;as when
the borings are made at the foot of an escarpment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> where the strata
incline inwards, or in a direction opposite to the face of the cliffs.</p>

</div>

<p>As instances of the way in which the character of the strata may
influence the water-bearing capacity of any given locality, we give the
following examples, taken from Baldwin Latham&#8217;s papers on &#8216;The Supply
of Water to Towns.&#8217; <a href="#i_014a">Fig. 1</a> illustrates the causes which sometimes
conduce to a limited supply of water in Artesian wells. Rain descending
on the outcrop E F of the porous stratum A, which lies between the
impervious stratum B B, will make its appearance in the form of a
spring at S; but such spring will not yield any great quantity of
water, as the area E F, which receives the rainfall, is limited in its
extent. A well sunk at W, in a stratum of the above description, would
not be likely to furnish a large supply of water, if any. The effect of
a fault is shown in <a href="#i_014b">Fig. 2</a>. A spring will in all probability make its
appearance at the point S, and give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> large quantities of water, as the
whole body of water flowing through the porous strata A is intercepted
by being thrown against the impermeable stratum B. Permeable rock
intersected by a dyke and overlying an impermeable stratum is seen
in <a href="#i_015a">Fig. 3</a>. The water flowing through A, if intersected by a dyke D,
will appear at S in the form of a spring, and if the area of A is of
large extent, then the spring S will be very copious. As to the depth
necessary to bore certain wells, in a case similar to <a href="#i_015b">Fig. 4</a>, owing
to the fault, a well sunk at A would require to be sunk deeper than
the well B, although both wells derive their supply from the same
description of strata. If there is any inclination in the water-bearing
strata, or if there is a current of water only in one direction, then
one of the wells would prove a failure owing to the proximity of the
fault, while the other would furnish an abundant supply of water.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_015a" id="i_015a"></a>
<img src="images/i_015a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="316" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>It should be borne in mind that there are two primary geological
conditions upon which the quantity of water that may be supplied to
the water-bearing strata depends; they are, the extent of superficial
area presented by these deposits, by which the quantity of rain-water
received on their surface in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> any given time is determined; and the
character and thickness of the strata, as by this the proportion of
water that can be absorbed, and the quantity which the whole volume
of the permeable strata can transmit, is regulated. The operation of
these general principles will constantly vary in accordance with local
phenomena, all of which must, in each separate case, be taken into
consideration.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_015b" id="i_015b"></a>
<img src="images/i_015b.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="143" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>The mere distance of hills or mountains need not discourage us from
making trials; for the waters which fall on these higher lands readily
penetrate to great depths through highly-inclined or vertical strata,
or through the fissures of shattered rocks; and after flowing for a
great distance, must often reascend and be brought up again by other
fissures, so as to approach the surface in the lower country. Here they
may be concealed beneath a covering of undisturbed horizontal beds,
which it may be necessary to pierce in order to reach them. The course
of water flowing underground is not strictly analogous to that of
rivers on the surface, there being, in the one case, a constant descent
from a higher to a lower level from the source of the stream to the
sea; whereas, in the other, the water may at one time sink far below
the level of the ocean, and afterwards rise again high above it.</p>

<p>For the purposes under consideration, we may range the various strata
of which the outer crust of the earth is composed under four heads,
namely: 1, drift; 2, alluvion; 3, the tertiary and secondary beds,
composed of loose, arenaceous and permeable strata, impervious,
argillaceous and marly strata, and thick strata of compact rock,
more or less broken up by fissures, as the Norwich red and coralline
crag, the Molasse sandstones, the Bagshot sands, the London clay, and
the Woolwich beds, in the tertiary division; and the chalk, chalk
marl, gault, the greensands, the Wealden clay, and the Hastings sand;
the oolites, the has, the Rh&aelig;tic beds, and Keuper, and the new red
sandstone, in the secondary division; and 4, the primary beds, as the
magnesian limestone, the lower red sand, and the coal measures, which
consist mainly of alternating beds of sandstones and shales with coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>The first of these divisions, the drift, consisting mainly of sand and
gravel, having been formed by the action of flowing water, is very
irregular in thickness, and exists frequently in detached masses. This
irregularity is due to the inequalities of the surface at the period
when the drift was brought down. Hollows then existing would often be
filled up, while either none was deposited on level surfaces, or, if
deposited, was subsequently removed by denudation. Hence we cannot
infer when boring through deposits of this character that the same, or
nearly the same, thickness will be found at even a few yards&#8217; distance.
In valleys this deposit may exist to a great depth, the slopes of hills
are frequently covered with drift, which has either been arrested by
the elevated surface or brought down from the upper portions of that
surface by the action of rain. In the former case the deposits will
probably consist of gravel, and in the latter, of the same elements as
the hill itself.</p>

<p>The permeability of such beds will, of course, depend wholly upon
the nature of the deposit. Some rocks produce deposits through which
water percolates readily, while others allow a passage only through
such fissures as may exist. Sand and gravel constitute an extremely
absorbent medium, while an argillaceous deposit may be wholly
impervious. In mountainous districts springs may often be found in
the drift; their existence in such formations will, however, depend
upon the position and character of the rock strata; thus, if the drift
cover an elevated and extensive slope of a nature similar to that of
the rocks by which it is formed, springs due to infiltration through
this covering will certainly exist near the foot of the slope. Upon the
opposite slope, the small spaces which exist between the different beds
of rock receive these infiltrations directly, and serve to completely
drain the deposit which, in the former case, is, on the contrary,
saturated with water. If, however, the foliations or the joints of the
rocks afford no issue to the water, whether such a circumstance be
due to the character of their formation, or to the stopping up of the
issues by the drift itself, these results will not be produced.</p>

<p>It will be obvious how, in this way, by passing under a mass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> of drift
the water descending from the top of hill slopes reappears at their
foot in the form of springs. If now we suppose these issues stopped, or
covered by an impervious stratum of great thickness, and this stratum
pierced by a boring, the water will ascend through this new outlet to a
level above that of its original issue, in virtue of the head of water
measured from the points at which the infiltration takes place to the
point in which it is struck by the boring.</p>

<p>Alluvion, like drift, consists of fragments of various strata carried
away and deposited by flowing water; it differs from the latter only
in being more extensive and regular, and, generally, in being composed
of elements brought from a great distance, and having no analogy with
the strata with which it is in contact. Usually it consists of sand,
gravel, rolled pebbles, marls or clays. The older deposits often occupy
very elevated districts, which they overlie throughout a large extent
of surface. At the period when the large rivers were formed, the
valleys were filled up with alluvial deposits, which at the present day
are covered by vegetable soil, and a rich growth of plants, through
which the water percolates more slowly than formerly. The permeability
of these deposits allows the water to flow away subterraneously to
a great distance from the points at which it enters. Springs are
common in the alluvion, and more frequently than in the case of drift,
they can be found by boring. As the surface, which is covered by the
deposit, is extensive, the water circulates from a distance through
permeable strata often overlaid by others that are impervious. If at a
considerable distance from the points of infiltration, and at a lower
level, a boring be put down, the water will ascend in the bore-hole
in virtue of its tendency to place itself in equilibrium. Where the
country is open and uninhabited, the water from shallow wells sunk
in alluvion is generally found to be good enough and in sufficient
quantity for domestic purposes.</p>

<p>The strata of the tertiary and secondary beds, especially the latter,
are far more extensive than the preceding, and yield much larger
quantities of water. The chalk is the great water-bearing stratum for
the larger portion of the south of England. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> water in it can be
obtained either by means of ordinary shafts, or by Artesian wells bored
sometimes to great depths, from which the water will frequently rise
to the surface. It should be observed that water does not circulate
through the chalk by general permeation of the mass, but through
fissures. A rule given by some for the level at which water may be
found in this stratum is, &#8220;Take the level of the highest source of
supply, and that of the lowest to be found. The mean level will be the
depth at which water will be found at any intermediate point, after
allowing an inclination of at least 10 feet a mile.&#8221; This rule will
also apply to the greensand. This formation contains large quantities
of water, which is more evenly distributed than in the chalk. The gault
clay is interposed between the upper and the lower greensand, the
latter of which also furnishes good supplies. In boring into the upper
greensand, caution should be observed so as not to pierce the gault
clay, because water which permeates through that system becomes either
ferruginous, or contaminated by salts and other impurities.</p>

<p>The next strata in which water is found are the upper and inferior
oolites, between which are the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, which are
separated by the coral rag. There are instances in which the Oxford
clay is met with immediately below the Kimmeridge, rendering any
attempt at boring useless, because the water in the Oxford clay is
generally so impure as to be unfit for use. And with regard to finding
water in the oolitic limestone, it is impossible to determine with any
amount of precision the depth at which it may be reached, owing to
the numerous faults which occur in the formation. It will therefore
be necessary to employ the greatest care before proceeding with any
borings. Lower down in the order are the upper has, the marlstone, the
lower has, and the new red sandstone. In the marlstone, between the
upper and lower beds of the has, there may be found a large supply
of water, but the level of this is as a rule too low to rise to the
surface through a boring. It will be necessary to sink shafts in the
ordinary way to reach it. In the new red sandstone, also, to find the
water, borings must be made to a considerable depth, but when this
formation exists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> a copious supply may be confidently anticipated, and
when found the water is of excellent quality.</p>

<p>Every permeable stratum may yield water, and its ability to do
this, and the quantity it can yield, depend upon its position and
extent. When underlaid by an impervious stratum, it constitutes a
reservoir of water from which a supply may be drawn by means of a
sinking or a bore-hole. If the permeable stratum be also overlaid
by an impervious stratum, the water will be under pressure and will
ascend the bore-hole to a height that will depend on the height of
the points of infiltration above the bottom of the bore-hole. The
quantity to be obtained in such a case as we have already pointed out,
will depend upon the extent of surface possessed by the outcrop of
the permeable stratum. In searching for water under such conditions a
careful examination of the geological features of the district must
be made. Frequently an extended view of the surface of the district,
such as may be obtained from an eminence, and a consideration of the
particular configuration of that surface, will be sufficient to enable
the practical eye to discover the various routes which are followed by
the subterranean water, and to predicate with some degree of certainty
that at a given point water will be found in abundance, or that no
water at all exists at that point. To do this, it is sufficient to
note the dip and the surfaces of the strata which are exposed to the
rains. When these strata are nearly horizontal, water can penetrate
them only through their fissures or pores; when, on the contrary, they
lie at right-angles, they absorb the larger portion of the water that
falls upon their outcrop. When such strata are intercepted by valleys,
numerous springs will exist. But if, instead of being intercepted, the
strata rise around a common point, they form a kind of irregular basin,
in the centre of which the water will accumulate. In this case the
surface springs will be less numerous than when the strata are broken.
But it is possible to obtain water under pressure in the lower portions
of the basin, if the point at which the trial is made is situate below
the outcrop.</p>

<p>The primary rocks afford generally but little water. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> been
subjected to violent convulsions, they are thrown into every possible
position and broken by numerous fissures; and as no permeable stratum
is interposed, as in the more recent formations, no reservoir of
water exists. In the unstratified rocks, the water circulates in all
directions through the fissures that traverse them, and thus occupies
no fixed level. It is also impossible to discover by a surface
examination where the fissures may be struck by a boring. For purposes
of water supply, therefore, these rocks are of little importance. It
must be remarked here, however, that large quantities of water are
frequently met with in the magnesian limestone and the lower red sand,
which form the upper portion of the primary series.</p>

<p>Joseph Prestwich, jun., in his &#8216;Geological Inquiry respecting the
Water-bearing Strata round London,&#8217; gives the following valuable
epitome of the geological conditions affecting the value of
water-bearing deposits; and although the illustrations are confined to
the Tertiary deposits, the same mode of inquiry will apply with but
little modification to any other formation.</p>

<p>The main points are&mdash;</p>

<p>The extent of the superficial area occupied by the water-bearing
deposit.</p>

<p>The lithological character and thickness of the water-bearing deposit,
and the extent of its underground range.</p>

<p>The position of the outcrop of the deposit, whether in valleys or
hills, and whether its outcrop is denuded, or covered with any
description of drift.</p>

<p>The general elevation of the country occupied by this outcrop above the
levels of the district in which it is proposed to sink wells.</p>

<p>The quantity of rain which falls in the district under consideration,
and whether, in addition, it receives any portion of the drainage from
adjoining tracts, when the strata are impermeable.</p>

<p>The disturbances which may affect the water-bearing strata, and break
their continuous character, as by this the subterranean flow of water
would be impeded or prevented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Extent of Superficial Area.</span></h3>

<p>To proceed to the application of the questions in the particular
instance of the lower tertiary strata. With regard to the first
question, it is evident that a series of permeable strata encased
between two impermeable formations can receive a supply of water at
those points only where they crop out and are exposed on the surface
of the land. The primary conditions affecting the result depend upon
the fall of rain in the district where the outcrop takes place; the
quantity of rain-water which any permeable strata can gather being in
the same ratio as their respective areas. If the mean annual fall in
any district amounts to 24 inches, then each square mile will receive
a daily average of 950,947 gallons of rain-water. It is therefore a
matter of essential importance to ascertain, with as much accuracy as
possible, the extent of exposed surface of any water-bearing deposit,
so as to determine the maximum quantity of rain-water it is capable of
receiving.</p>

<p>The surface formed by the outcropping of any deposit in a country of
hill and valley is necessarily extremely limited, and it would be
difficult to measure in the ordinary way. Prestwich therefore used
another method, which seems to give results sufficiently accurate for
the purpose. It is a plan borrowed from geographers, that of cutting
out from a map on paper of uniform thickness and on a large scale,
say one inch to the mile, and weighing the superficial area of each
deposit. Knowing the weight of a square of 100 miles cut out of the
same paper, it is easy to estimate roughly the area in square miles of
any other surface, whatever may be its figure.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mineral Character of the Formation.</span></h3>

<p>The second question relates to the mineral character of the formation,
and the effect it will have upon the quantity of water which it may
hold or transmit.</p>

<p>If the strata consist of sand, water will pass through them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> with
facility, and they will also hold a considerable quantity between the
interstices of their component grains; whereas a bed of pure clay
will not allow of the passage of water. These are the two extremes
of the case; the intermixture of these materials in the same bed
will of course, according to their relative proportions, modify the
transmission of water. Prestwich found by experiment that a silicious
sand of ordinary character will hold on an average rather more than
one-third of its bulk of water, or from two to two and a half gallons
in one cubic foot. In strata so composed the water may be termed
free, as it passes easily in all directions, and under the pressure
of a column of water is comparatively but little impeded by capillary
attraction. These are the conditions of a true permeable stratum. Where
the strata are more compact and solid, as in sandstone, limestone,
and oolite, although all such rocks imbibe more or less water, yet
the water so absorbed does not pass freely through the mass, but is
held in the pores of the rock by capillary attraction, and parted with
very slowly; so that in such deposits water can be freely transmitted
only in the planes of bedding and in fissures. If the water-bearing
deposit is of uniform lithological character over a large area, then
the proposition is reduced to its simplest form; but when, as in the
deposit between the London clay and the chalk, the strata consist of
variable mineral ingredients, it becomes essential to estimate the
extent of these variations; for very different conclusions might be
drawn from an inspection of the Lower Tertiary strata at different
localities.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 5.<br />
<i>a</i> London clay, <i>b</i> Sands and<br />
clay, <i>c</i> Chalk.</p>
</div>

<p>In the fine section exposed in the cliffs between Herne Bay and the
Reculvers, in England, a considerable mass of fossiliferous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> sands is
seen to rise from beneath the London clay. <a href="#i_023">Fig. 5</a> represents a view
of a portion of this cliff a mile and a half east of Herne Bay and
continued downwards, by estimation below the surface of the ground to
the chalk. In this section there is evidently a very large proportion
of sand, and consequently a large capacity for water. Again, at Upnor,
near Rochester, the sands marked 3 are as much as 60 to 80 feet thick,
and continue so to Gravesend, Purfleet, and Erith. In the first of
these places they may be seen capping Windmill Hill; in the second,
forming the hill, now removed, on which the lighthouse is built; and in
the third, in the large ballast pits on the banks of the river Thames.
The average thickness of these sands in this district may be about 50
to 60 feet. In their range from east to west, the beds 2 become more
clayey and less permeable, and 1, very thin. As we approach London the
thickness of 3 also diminishes. In the ballast pits at the west end
of Woolwich, this sand-bed is not more than 35 feet thick, and as it
passes under London becomes still thinner.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_024a" id="i_024a"></a>
<img src="images/i_024a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="288" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 6.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_024a">Fig. 6</a> is a general or average section of the strata on which London
stands. The increase in the proportion of the argillaceous strata,
and the decrease of the beds of sand, in the Lower Tertiary strata is
here very apparent, and from this point westward to Hungerford, clays
decidedly predominate; while at the same time the series presents such
rapid variations, even on the same level and at short distances, that
no two sections are alike. On the southern boundary of the Tertiary
district, from Croydon to Leatherhead, the sands 3 maintain a thickness
of 20 to 40 feet, whilst the associated beds of clay are of inferior
importance. We will take another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> section, Fig. 7, representing the
usual features of the deposit in the northern part of the Tertiary
district. It is from a cutting at a brickfield west of the small
village of Hedgerley, 6 miles northward of Windsor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_024b" id="i_024b"></a>
<img src="images/i_024b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="242" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Here we see a large development of the mottled clays, and but little
sand. A somewhat similar section is exhibited at Oak End, near Chalfont
St. Giles. But to show how rapidly this series changes its character,
the section of a pit only a third of a mile westward of the one at
Hedgerley is given in <a href="#i_025">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_025" id="i_025"></a>
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="204" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>In this latter section the mottled clays have nearly disappeared, and
are replaced by beds of sand with thin seams of mottled clays. At
Twyford, near Reading, and at Old Basing, near Basingstoke, the mottled
clays again occupy, as at Hedgerley, nearly the whole space between the
London clays and the chalk. Near Reading a good section of these beds
was exhibited in the Sonning cutting of the Great Western Railway; they
consisted chiefly of mottled clays. At the Katsgrove pits, Reading, the
beds are more sandy. Referring back to <a href="#i_024a">Fig. 6</a>, it may be noticed that
there is generally a small quantity of water found in the bed marked
1, in parts of the neighbourhood of London. Owing, however, to the
constant presence of green and ferruginous sands, traces of vegetable
matters and remains of fossil shells, the water is usually indifferent
and chalybeate. The well-diggers term this a slow spring. They well
express the difference by saying that the water creeps up from this
stratum, whereas that it bursts up from the lower sands 3, which is the
great water-bearing stratum. In the irregular sand-beds interstratified
with the mottled clays between these two strata water is also found,
but not in any large quantity.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_026" id="i_026"></a>
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="215" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_026">Fig. 9</a> is a section at the western extremity of the Tertiary district
at Pebble Hill, near Hungerford. Here again the mottled clays are in
considerable force, sands forming the smaller part of the series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
The following lists exhibit the aggregate thickness of all the beds
of sand occurring between the London clay and the chalk at various
localities in the Tertiary district. It will appear from them that the
mean results of the whole is very different from any of those obtained
in separate divisions of the country. The mean thickness of the deposit
throughout the whole Tertiary area may be taken at 62 feet, of which
36 feet consist of sands and 26 feet of clays; but as only a portion
of this district contributes to the water supply of London, it will
facilitate our inquiry if we divide it into two parts, the one westward
of and including London, and the other eastward of it, introducing also
some further subdivisions into each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>The average total thickness of the eastern district deduced from the
nine sections we have taken gives 68 feet, of which 53 feet are sands
and 15 feet clays. The larger area, 1849 square miles, over which the
eastern portion of the Tertiary series extends, and the greater volume
of the water-bearing beds, constitute important differences in favour
of this district; and if there had been no geological disturbances to
interfere with the continuous character of the strata, we might have
looked to this quarter for a large supply of water to the Artesian
wells of London.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_028" id="i_028"></a>
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="177" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 10.</p>
</div>

<p>From these tables it will be readily perceived that the strata of
which the water-bearing deposits are composed are very variable in
their relative thickness. They consist, in fact, of alternating beds
of clay and sand, in proportions constantly changing. In one place,
as at Hedgerley, the aggregate beds of sand may be 5 feet thick, and
the clays 45 feet; whilst at another, as at Leatherhead, the sands
may be 35, and the clays 20 feet thick, and some such variation is
observable in every locality. But although we may thus in some measure
judge of the capacity of these beds for water, this method fails to
show whether the communication from one part of the area to another
is free, or impeded by causes connected with mineral character. Now
as we know that these beds not only vary in their thickness, but that
they also frequently thin out, and sometimes pass one into another, it
may happen that a very large development of clay at any one place may
altogether stop the transit of the water in that locality. Thus in <a href="#i_028">Fig.
10</a> the beds of sand at <i>y</i> allow of the free passage of water, but at <i>x</i>,
where clays occupy the whole thickness, it cannot pass; the obstruction
which this cause may offer to the underground flow of water can only
be determined by experience. It must not, however, be supposed that
such a variation in the strata is permanent or general along any given
line. It is always local, some of the beds of clay commonly thinning
out after a certain horizontal range, so that, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> the water may
be impeded or retarded in a direct course, it most probably can, in
part or altogether, pass round by some point where the strata have not
undergone the same alteration.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Position and General Conditions of the Outcrop.</span></h3>

<p>This involves some considerations to which an exact value cannot at
present be given, yet which require notice, as they to a great extent
determine the proportion of water which can pass from the surface into
the mass of the water-bearing strata. In the first place, when the
outcrop of these strata occurs in a valley, as represented in <a href="#i_029">Fig.
11</a>, it is evident that <i>b</i> may not only retain all the water which
might fall on its surface, but also would receive a proportion of that
draining off from the strata of <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>. This form of the surface
generally prevails wherever the water-bearing strata are softer and
less coherent than the strata above and below them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_029" id="i_029"></a>
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="83" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 11.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be observed in the Lower Tertiary series at Sutton, Carshalton,
and Croydon, where a small and shallow valley, excavated in these sands
and mottled clays, ranges parallel with the chalk hills.</p>

<p>It is apparent again between Epsom and Leatherhead, and also in some
places between Guildford and Farnham, as well as between Odiham and
Kingsclere. The Southampton Railway crosses this small valley on an
embankment at Old Basing.</p>

<p>This may be considered as the prevailing, but not exclusive, form of
structure from Croydon to near Hungerford. The advantage, however,
to be gained from it in point of water supply is much limited by the
rather high angle at which the strata are inclined, as well as by their
small development, which greatly restrict the breadth of the surface
occupied by the outcrop. It rarely exceeds a quarter of a mile, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
generally very much less, often not more than 100 to 200 feet. The next
modification of outcrop, represented in <a href="#i_030a">Fig. 12</a>, is one not uncommon on
the south side of the Tertiary district. The strata <i>b</i> here crop out
on the slope of the chalk hills, and the rain falling upon them, unless
rapidly absorbed, tends to drain at once from their surface into the
adjacent valleys. V, L, shows the line of valley level.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_030a" id="i_030a"></a>
<img src="images/i_030a.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="158" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>This arrangement is not unfrequent between Kingsclere and Inkpen,
and also between Guildford and Leatherhead. Eastward of London it is
exhibited on a larger scale at the base of the chalk hills, in places
between Chatham and Faversham, a line along which the sands of the
Lower Tertiary strata, <i>b</i>, are more fully developed than elsewhere.
As, however, the surface of <i>b</i> is there usually more coincident with
the valley level, V, L, of the district, it is in a better position for
retaining more of the rainfall.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_030b" id="i_030b"></a>
<img src="images/i_030b.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="102" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13.</p>
</div>

<p>A third position of outcrop, much more unfavourable for the
water-bearing strata, prevails generally along the greater part of the
northern boundary of the Tertiary strata. Instead of forming a valley,
or outcropping at the base of the chalk hills, almost the whole length
of this outcrop lies on the slope of the hills, as in <a href="#i_030b">Fig. 13</a>, where
the chalk <i>c</i> forms the base of the hill and the lower ground at its
foot, whilst the London clay, <i>a</i>, caps the summit, thus restricting
the outcrop of <i>b</i> to a very narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> zone and a sloping surface. This
form of structure is exhibited in the hills round Sonning, Reading,
Hedgerley, Rickmansworth, and Watford; thence by Shenley Hill,
Hatfield, Hertford, Sudbury; and also at Hadleigh this position of
outcrop is continued. If, as on the southern side of the Tertiary
district, the outcrop were continued in a nearly unbroken line, then
these unfavourable conditions would prevail uninterruptedly; but the
hills are in broken groups, and intersected at short distances by
transverse valleys, as that of the Kennet at Reading, of the Loddon
at Twyford, of the Colne at Uxbridge, and so on. Between Watford and
Hatfield there is a constant succession of small valleys running back
for short distances from the Lower district of the chalk, through the
hills of the Tertiary district. The Valley of the Lea at Roydon and
Hoddesdon is a similar and stronger case in point. The effect of these
transverse valleys is to open out a larger surface of the strata <i>b</i>
than would otherwise be exposed, for if the horizontal line, V, L, <a href="#i_030b">Fig.
13</a>, were carried back beyond the point <i>x</i>, to meet the prolongation
of <i>b</i>, then these Lower Tertiary strata would not only be intersected
by the line of valley level, but would form a much smaller angle with
the plane V, L, and therefore spread over a larger area than where they
crop out on the side of the hills.</p>

<p>The foregoing are the three most general forms of outcrop, but
occasionally the outcrop takes place wholly or partly on the summit
of a hill, as, near the Reculvers in the neighbourhood of Canterbury,
of Sittingbourne, and at the Addington Hills, near Croydon, in which
cases the area of the Lower Tertiary is expanded. When the dip is
very slight, and the beds nearly horizontal, the Lower Tertiary sands
occasionally spread over a still larger extent of surface, as between
Stoke Pogis, Burnham Common, and Beaconsfield, and in the case of the
flat-topped hill, forming Blackheath and Bexley Heath, as in <a href="#i_032">Fig. 14</a>.
Favourable as such districts might at first appear to be from the
extent of their exposed surface, nevertheless they rarely contribute
to the water supply of the wells sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> into the Lower Tertiary sands
under London, the continuity of the strata being broken by intersecting
valleys; thus the district last mentioned is bounded on the north by
the valley of the Thames, on the west by that of Ravensbourne, and on
the east by the valley of the Cray; consequently the rain-water, which
has been absorbed by the very permeable strata on the intermediate
higher ground, passes out on the sides of the hills, into the surface
channels in the valleys, or into the chalk. Almost all the wells at
Bexley Heath, for their supply of water, have, in fact, to be sunk into
the chalk through the overlying 100 to 133 feet of sand and pebble
beds, <i>b</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_032" id="i_032"></a>
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="43" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus far we have considered this question, as if, in each instance,
the outcropping edges of the water-bearing strata, <i>b</i>, were laid
bare, and presented no impediment to the absorption of the rain-water
falling immediately upon their surface, or passing on to it from some
more impermeable deposits. But there is another consideration which
influences materially the extent of the water supply.</p>

<p>If the strata <i>b</i> were always bare, we should have to consider their
outcrop as an absorbent surface, of power varying according to the
lithological character and dip of the strata only. But the outcropping
edges of the strata do not commonly present bare and denuded surfaces.
Thus a large extent of the country round London is more or less covered
by beds of drift, which protect the outcropping beds of <i>b</i>, and turn
off a portion of the water falling upon them.</p>

<p>The drift differs considerably in its power of interference with the
passage of the rain-water into the strata beneath. The ochreous sandy
flint gravel, forming so generally the subsoil of London, admits of the
passage of water. All the shallow surface springs, from 10 to 20 feet
deep, are produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> by water which has fallen on, and passed through,
this gravel, <i>g</i>, <a href="#i_033a">Fig. 15</a>, down to the top of the London clay, <i>a</i>, on
the irregular surface of which it is held up.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_033a" id="i_033a"></a>
<img src="images/i_033a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="114" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>When the London clay is wanting, this gravel lies immediately upon the
Lower Tertiary strata, as in the valley between Windsor and Maidenhead,
and in that of the Kennet between Newbury and Thatcham, transmitting to
the underlying strata part of the surface water. Where beds of brick
earth occur in the drift, as between West Drayton and Uxbridge, the
passage of the surface water into the underlying strata is intercepted.</p>

<p>Sometimes the drift is composed of gravel mixed very irregularly with
broken up London clay, and although commonly not more than 3 to 8 feet
thick, it is generally impermeable.</p>

<p>Over a considerable portion of Suffolk and part of Essex, a drift,
composed of coarse and usually light-coloured sand with fine gravel,
occurs. Water percolates through it with extreme facility, but it
is generally covered by a thick mass of stiff tenacious bluish grey
clay, perfectly impervious. This clay drift, or boulder clay, caps,
to a depth of from 10 to 50 feet or more, almost all the hills in the
northern division of Essex, and a large portion of Suffolk and Norfolk.
It so conceals the underlying strata that it is difficult to trace the
course of the outcrop of the Lower Tertiary sands between Ware and
Ipswich; and often, as in <a href="#i_033b">Fig. 16</a>, notwithstanding the breadth, apart
from this cause of the outcrop of the Tertiary sands, <i>b</i>, and of the
drift of sand and gravel, 2, they are both so covered by the boulder
clay, 1, that the small surface exposed can be of comparatively little
value.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_033b" id="i_033b"></a>
<img src="images/i_033b.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="87" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p>There are also, in some valleys, river deposits of silt, mud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> and
gravel. These are, however, of little importance to the subject
before us. Under ordinary conditions they are generally sufficiently
impervious to prevent the water from passing through the beds beneath.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Height of Water-bearing Strata above Surface of Country.</span></h3>

<p>The height of the districts, wherein the water-bearing strata crop out,
above that of the surface of the country in which the wells are placed,
should be made the subject of careful consideration, as upon this point
depends the level to which the water in Artesian wells may ascend.</p>

<p>Again, taking the London district as an example, Prestwich remarks
that, as the country rises on both sides of the Thames to the edge of
the chalk escarpments, and as the outcrop of the Lower Tertiary strata
is intermediate between these escarpments and the Thames, it follows
that the outcrop of these lower beds must, in all cases, be on a higher
level than the Thames itself, where it flows through the centre of the
Tertiary district. Its altitude is, of course, very variable, as shown
in the following list of its approximate height above Trinity high
water-mark at London. These heights are taken where the Tertiaries are
at their lowest level in the several localities mentioned.</p>

<p>Eastward of London these strata crop out at a gradually decreasing
level. In consequence, therefore, of the outcrop of the water-bearing
strata being thus much above the surface of the central Tertiary
district bordering the Thames, the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> in these strata beneath
London tended originally to rise above that surface.</p>

<p>As, however, these beds crop out on a level with the Thames immediately
east of the city between Deptford, Blackwall, and Bow, the water,
having this natural issue so near, could never have risen in London
much above the level of the river.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rainfall in the District where the Water-bearing Strata Crop
out.</span></h3>

<p>When inquiring into the probable relative value of any water-bearing
strata, it is necessary to compare the rainfall in their respective
districts.</p>

<p>Rain is of all meteorological phenomena the most capricious, both as
regards its frequency and the amount which falls in a given time.
In some places it rarely or never falls, whilst in others it rains
almost every day; and there does not yet exist any theory from which a
probable estimate of the rainfall in a given district can be deduced
independently of direct observation. But although dealing with one of
the most capricious of the elements, we nevertheless find a workable
average in the quantity of rain to be expected in any particular place,
if careful and continued observations are made with the rain-gauge. G.
J. Symons, the meteorologist, to whose continued investigations we are
indebted for our most reliable data upon the subject of rainfall, gives
the following practical instructions for using a rain-gauge;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mouth of the gauge must be set quite level, and so fixed that it
will remain so; it should never be less than 6 inches above the ground,
nor more than 1 foot except when a greater elevation is absolutely
necessary to obtain a proper exposure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be set on a level piece of ground, at a distance from shrubs,
trees, walls, and buildings, at the very least as many feet from their
base as they are in height.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a thoroughly clear site cannot be obtained, shelter is most
endurable from N.W., N., and E., less so from S., S.E., and W., and not
at all from S.W. or N.E.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>&#8220;Special prohibition must issue as to keeping all tall-growing flowers
away from the gauges.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to prevent rust, it will be desirable to give the japanned
gauges a coat of paint every two or three years.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gauge should, if possible, be emptied daily at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
and the amount entered against the previous day.</p>

<p>&#8220;When making an observation, care should be taken to hold the glass
upright.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can hardly be necessary to give here a treatise on decimal
arithmetic; suffice it therefore to say that rain-gauge glasses usually
hold half an inch of rain (0&#183;50) and that each <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub> (0&#183;01) is marked;
if the fall is less than half an inch, the number of hundredths is read
off at once, if it is over half an inch, the glass must be filled up to
the half inch (0&#183;50), and the remainder (say 0&#183;22) measured afterwards,
the total (0&#183;50 + 0&#183;22) &#61; 0&#183;72 being entered. If less than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> (0&#183;10)
has fallen, the cipher must always be prefixed; thus if the measure
is full up to the seventh line, it must be entered as 0&#183;07, that is,
no inches, no tenths, and seven hundredths. For the sake of clearness
it has been found necessary to lay down an invariable rule that there
shall always be two figures to the right of the decimal point. If there
be only one figure, as in the case of one-tenth of an inch, usually
written 0&#183;1, a cipher must be added, making it 0&#183;10. Neglect of this
rule causes much inconvenience.</p>

<p>&#8220;In snow three methods may be adopted&mdash;it is well to try them all. 1.
Melt what is caught in the funnel, and measure that as rain. 2. Select
a place where the snow has not drifted, invert the funnel, and turning
it round, lift and melt what is enclosed. 3. Measure with a rule the
average depth of snow, and take one-twelfth as the equivalent of water.
Some observers use in snowy weather a cylinder of the same diameter as
the rain-gauge, and of considerable depth. If the wind is at all rough,
all the snow is blown out of a flat-funnelled rain-gauge.&#8221;</p>

<p>A drainage area is almost always a district of country enclosed by
a ridge or watershed line, continuous except at the place where the
waters of the basin find an outlet. It may be, and generally is,
divided by branch ridge-lines into a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> smaller basins, each
drained by its own stream into the main stream. In order to measure
the area of a catchment basin a plan of the country is required, which
either shows the ridge-lines or gives data for finding their positions
by means of detached levels, or of contour lines.</p>

<p>When a catchment basin is very extensive it is advisable to measure the
smaller basins of which it consists, as the depths of rainfall in them
may be different; and sometimes, also, for the same reason, to divide
those basins into portions at different distances from the mountain
chains, where rain-clouds are chiefly formed.</p>

<p>The exceptional cases, in which the boundary of a drainage area is not
a ridge-line on the surface of the country, are those in which the
rain-water sinks into a porous stratum until its descent is stopped
by an impervious stratum, and in which, consequently, one boundary at
least of the drainage area depends on the figure of the impervious
stratum, being, in fact, a ridge-line on the upper surface of that
stratum, instead of on the ground, and very often marking the upper
edge of the outcrop of that stratum. If the porous stratum is partly
covered by a second impervious stratum, the nearest ridge-line on the
latter stratum to the point where the porous stratum crops out will be
another boundary of the drainage area. In order to determine a drainage
area under these circumstances it is necessary to have a geological map
and sections of the district.</p>

<p>The depth of rainfall in a given time varies to a great extent at
different seasons, in different years, and in different places. The
extreme limits of annual depth of rainfall in different parts of the
world may be held to be respectively nothing and 150 inches. The
average annual depth of rainfall in different parts of Britain ranges
from 22 inches to 140 inches, and the least annual depth recorded in
Britain is about 15 inches.</p>

<p>The rainfall in different parts of a given country is, in general,
greatest in those districts which lie towards the quarter from which
the prevailing winds blow; in Great Britain, for instance, the western
districts have the most rain. Upon a given mountain ridge, however,
the reverse is the case, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> greatest rainfall taking place on that
side which lies to leeward, as regards the prevailing winds. To the
same cause may be ascribed the fact that the rainfall is greater in
mountainous than in flat districts, and greater at points near high
mountain summits than at points farther from them; and the difference
due to elevation is often greater by far than that due to 100 miles
geographical distance.</p>

<p>The most important data respecting the depth of rainfall in a given
district, for practical purposes, are, the least annual rainfall; mean
annual rainfall; greatest annual rainfall; distribution of the rainfall
at different seasons, and especially, the longest continuous drought;
greatest flood rainfall, or continuous fall of rain in a short period.</p>

<p>The available rainfall of a district is that part of the total rainfall
which remains to be stored in reservoirs, or carried away by streams,
after deducting the loss through evaporation, through permanent
absorption by plants and by the ground, and other causes.</p>

<p>The proportion borne by the available to the total rainfall varies
very much, being affected by the rapidity of the rainfall and the
compactness or porosity of the soil, the steepness or flatness of
the ground, the nature and quantity of the vegetation upon it,
the temperature and moisture of the air, which will affect the
rate of evaporation, the existence of artificial drains, and other
circumstances. The following are examples:</p>

<div class="center">

<tr>
<td class="center"><span class="small">Ground.</span></td>
<td class="center"><span class="small">Available Rainfall.</span><br />

<tr>
<td>Chalk</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Deep-seated springs and wells give from &#183;3 to &#183;4 of the total rainfall.
Stephenson found that for the chalk district round Watford the
evaporation was about 34 per cent., the quantity carried off by streams
23&#183;2 per cent., leaving 42&#183;8 per cent., which sank below the surface
to form springs. In formations less absorbent than the chalk it can be
calculated roughly, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> streams carry off one-third, that another
third evaporates, and that the remaining third of the total rainfall
sinks into the earth.</p>

<p>Such data as the above may be used in approximately estimating the
probable available rainfall of a district; but a much more accurate and
satisfactory method is to measure the actual discharge of the streams,
and the quantity lost by evaporation, at the same time that the
rain-gauge observations are made, and so to find the actual proportion
of available to total rainfall.</p>

the world;&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Disturbances of the Strata.</span></h3>

<p>The last question to be considered relates to the disturbances which
may have affected the strata; for whatever may be the absorbent power
of the strata, the yield of water will be more or less diminished
whenever the channels of communication have suffered break or fracture.</p>

<p>If the strata remained continuous and unbroken, we should merely have
to ascertain the dimensions and lithological character of the strata
in order to determine their water value. But if the strata is broken,
the interference with the subterranean transmission of water will be
proportionate to the extent of the disturbance.</p>

<p>Although the Tertiary formations around London have probably suffered
less from the action of disturbing forces than the strata of any other
district of the same extent in England, yet they nevertheless now
exhibit considerable alterations from their original position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>The principal change has been that which, by elevation of the sides or
depression of the centre of the district, gave the Tertiary deposits
their present trough-shaped form, assuming it not to be the result of
original deposition. If no further change had taken place we might have
expected to find an uninterrupted communication in the Lower Tertiary
strata from their northern outcrop at Hertford to their southern
outcrop at Croydon, as well as from Newbury on the west to the sea on
the east; and the entire length of 260 miles of outcrop would have
contributed to the general supply of water at the centre.</p>

<p>But this is far from being the case; several disturbing causes have
deranged the regularity of original structure. The principal one has
caused a low axis of elevation, or rather a line of flexure running
east and west, following nearly the course of the Thames from the Nore
to Deptford, and apparently continued thence beyond Windsor. It brings
up the chalk at Cliff, Purfleet, Woolwich, and Loampit Hill to varied
but moderate elevations above the river level. Between Lewisham and
Deptford the chalk disappears below the Tertiary series, and does not
come to the surface till we reach the neighbourhood of Windsor and
Maidenhead.</p>

<p>There is also, probably, another line of disturbance running between
some points north and south and intersecting the first line at
Deptford. It passes apparently near Beckenham and Lewisham, and then,
crossing the Thames near Deptford, continues up a part, if not along
the whole length of the valley of the Lea towards Hoddesdon. This
disturbance appears in some places to have resulted in a fracture or
a fault in the strata, placing the beds on the east of it on a higher
level than those on the west; and at other places merely to have
produced a curvature in the strata. Prestwich states that he was unable
to give its exact course, but its effect, at all events upon the water
supply of London, is important, as, in conjunction with the first or
Thames valley disturbance, it cuts off the supplies from the whole of
Kent, and interferes most materially with the supply from Essex; for
in its course up the valley of the Lea it either brings up the Lower
Tertiary strata to the surface, as at Stratford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> and Bow, or else, as
farther up the valley, it raises them to within 40 or 60 feet of the
surface.</p>

<p>The Tertiary district thus appears, on a general view, to be divided
naturally into four portions by lines running nearly north and south,
the former line passing immediately south, and the latter east of
London, which stands at the south-east corner of the north-western
division, and consequently it must not be viewed as the centre of one
large and unbroken area, so far as the Tertiary strata are concerned.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<span class="small">THE NEW RED SANDSTONE.</span></h2>

<p>This formation has been already alluded to at pp. <a href="#Page_5">5</a> and <a href="#Page_8">8</a>; it is,
next to the chalk and lower greensand, the most extensive source of
water supply from wells we have in England, and although the two
formations mentioned occupy a larger area, yet, owing to geographical
position, the new red sandstone receives a more considerable quantity
of rainfall, and, owing to the comparative scarceness of carbonate of
lime, yields softer water.</p>

<p>The new red sandstone is called on the Continent &#8220;the Trias,&#8221; as in
Germany and parts of France it presents a distinct threefold division.
Although the names of each of the divisions are commonly used, they
are in themselves local and unessential, as the same exact relations
between them do not occur in other remote parts of Europe or in
England, and are not to be looked for in distant continents. The names
of the divisions and their English equivalents are:</p>

<p>1. Keuper, or red marls.</p>

<p>2. Muschelkalk, or shell limestones (not found in this country).</p>

<p>3. Bunter sandstone, or variegated sandstone.</p>

<p>The strata consist in general of red, mottled, purple, or yellowish
sandstones and marls, with beds of rock-salt, gypsum pebbles, and
conglomerate.</p>

<p>The region over which triassic rocks outcrop in England stretches
across the island from a point in the south-western part of the English
Channel about Exmouth, Devon, north-north-eastward, and also from the
centre of this band along a north-westward course to Liverpool, thence
dividing and running north-east to the Tees, and north-west to Solway
Firth.</p>

<p>In central Europe the trias is found largely developed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> in North
America it covers an area whose aggregate length is some 700 or 800
miles.</p>

<p>The beds, in England, may be divided as follows;</p>

<p>The Keuper series is introduced by a conglomerate often calcareous,
passing up into brown, yellow, or white freestone, and then into thinly
laminated sandstones and marls. The other subdivisions are remarkably
uniform in character, except in the case of the pebble beds, which
in the north-west form a light red pebbly building stone, but in the
central counties becomes generally an unconsolidated conglomerate of
quartzose pebbles.</p>

<p>The following tabulated form, due to Edward Hull, Esq., M.A., shows
the comparative thickness and range of the Triassic series along a
south-easterly direction from the estuary of the Mersey, and also
shows the thinning away of all the Triassic strata from the north-west
towards the south-east of England, which Hull was amongst the first to
demonstrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>The formation may be looked upon as almost equally permeable in all
directions, and the whole mass may be regarded as a reservoir up to a
certain level, from which, whenever wells are sunk, water will always
be obtained more or less abundantly, This view is very fairly borne out
by experience, and the occurrence of the water is certainly not solely
due to the presence of the fissures or joints traversing the rock, but
to its permeability, which, however, varies in different districts.
In the neighbourhood of Liverpool the rock, or at least the pebble
bed, is less porous than in the neighbourhood of Whitmore, Nottingham,
and other parts of the midland counties, where it becomes either an
unconsolidated conglomerate or a soft crumbly sandstone. Yet wells
sunk even in the hard building stone of the pebble beds, either in
Cheshire or Lancashire, always yield water at a certain variable depth.
Beyond a certain depth the water tends to decrease, as was the case
in the St. Helen&#8217;s public well, situated on Eccleston Hill. At this
well an attempt was made, in 1868, to increase the supply by boring
deeper into the sandstone, but without any good result. When water
percolates downwards in the rock we may suppose there are two forces
of an antagonistic character brought into play; there is the force of
friction, increasing with the depth, and tending to hinder the downward
progress of the water, while there is the hydrostatic pressure tending
to force the water downwards; and we may suppose that when equilibrium
has been established between these two forces, the further percolation
will cease.</p>

<p>The proportion of rain which finds it way into the rock in some parts
of the country must be very large. When the rock, as is generally the
case in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Shropshire, is partly overspread
by a coating of dense boulder clay, almost impervious to water, the
quantity probably does not exceed one-third of the rainfall over a
considerable area; but in some parts of the midland counties, where
the rock is very open, and the covering of drift scanty or altogether
absent, the percolation amounts to a much larger proportion, probably
one-half or two-thirds, as all the rain which is not evaporated passes
downwards. The new red sandstone, as remarked, may be regarded, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
respect to water supply, as a nearly homogeneous mass, equally available
throughout; and it is owing to this structure, and the almost entire
absence of beds of impervious clay or marl, that the formation is
capable of affording such large supplies of water; for the rain which
falls on its surface and penetrates into the rock is free to pass in
any direction towards a well when sunk in a central position. If we
consider the rock as a mass completely saturated with water through
a certain vertical depth, the water being in a state of equilibrium,
when a well is sunk, and the water pumped up, the state of equilibrium
is destroyed, and the water in the rock is forced in from all sides.
The percolation is, doubtless, much facilitated by joints, fissures,
and faults, and in cases where one side of a fault is composed of
impervious strata, such as the Keuper marls, or coal measures, the
quantity of water pent up against the face of the fault may be very
large, and the position often favourable for a well. An instance of
the effect of faults in the rock itself, in increasing the supply, is
afforded in the case of the well at Flaybrick Hill, near Birkenhead.
From the bottom of this well a heading was driven at a depth of about
160 feet from the surface, to cut a fault about 150 feet distant,
and upon this having been effected the water flowed in with such
impetuosity that the supply, which had been 400,000 gallons a day, was
at once doubled.</p>

<p>The water from the new red sandstone is clear, wholesome, and pleasant
to drink; it is also well adapted for the purposes of bleaching,
dyeing, and brewing; at the same time it must be admitted that its
qualities as regards hardness, in other words, the proportions
of carbonates of limes and magnesia it contains, are subject to
considerable variation, depending on the locality and composition of
the rock. As a general rule, the water from the new red sandstone
may be considered as occupying a position intermediate between the
<i>hard</i> water of the chalk, and the <i>soft</i> water supplied to some of
our large towns from the drainage of mountainous tracts of the primary
formations, of which the water supplied from Loch Katrine to Glasgow
is perhaps the purest example, containing only 2&#183;35 grains of solid
matter to the gallon. Having besides but a small proportion of saline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
ingredients, which, while they tend to harden the water, are probably
not without benefit in the animal economy, the water supply from the
new red sandstone possesses incalculable advantages over that from
rivers and surface drainage. Many of our large towns are now partially
or entirely supplied with water pumped from deep wells in this
sandstone; and several from copious springs gushing forth from the rock
at its junction with some underlying impervious stratum belonging to
the primary series.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<span class="small">WELL SINKING.</span></h2>

<p>Previous to sinking it will be necessary to have in readiness a stock
of buckets, shovels, picks, rope, a pulley-block or a windlass, and
barrows or other means of conveying the material extracted away from
the mouth of the sinking. After all the preliminary arrangements have
been made, the sinking is commenced by marking off a circle upon the
ground 12 or 18 inches greater in circumference than the intended
internal diameter of the well. The centre of the well as commenced from
must be the centre of every part of the sinking; its position must
be carefully preserved, and everything that is done must be true to
this centre, the plumb-line being frequently used to test the vertical
position of the sides.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_052tb" id="i_052tb"></a>

</div>

<p>To sink a well by underpinning, an excavation is first made to such a
depth as the strata will allow without falling in. At the bottom of
the excavation is laid a curb, that is, a flat ring, whose internal
diameter is equal to the intended clear diameter of the well, and
its breadth equal to the thickness of the brickwork. It is made of
oak or elm planks 3 or 4 inches thick, either in one layer fished at
the joints with iron, or in two layers breaking joint, and spiked or
screwed together. On this, to line the first division of the well, a
cylinder of brickwork, technically called steining, is built in mortar
or cement. In the centre of the floor is dug a small pit, at the bottom
of which is laid a small platform of boards; then, by cutting notches
in the side of the pit, raking props are inserted, their lower ends
abutting against a foot block, and their upper ends against the lowest
setting, so as to give temporary support to the curb with its load of
brickwork. The pit is enlarged to the diameter of the shaft above; on
the bottom of the excavation is laid a new curb, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> which is built a new division of the
brickwork, giving permanent support to the upper curb; the raking props
and their foot-blocks are removed; a new pit is dug, and so on as
before. Care should be taken that the earth is firmly packed behind the
steining.</p>

<p>A common modification of this method consists in excavating to such a
depth as the strata will admit without falling in. A wooden curb is
laid at the bottom of the excavation, the brick steining laid upon it
and carried to the surface. The earth is then excavated flush with
the interior sides of the well, so that the earth underneath the curb
supports the brickwork above. When the excavation has been carried
on as far as convenient, recesses are made in the earth under the
previous steining, and in these recesses the steining is carried up to
the previous work. When thus supported the intermediate portions of
earth between the sections of brickwork carried up are cut away and the
steining completed.</p>

<p>In sinking with a drum curb, the curb, which may be either of wood
or iron, consists of a flat ring for supporting the steining, and of
a vertical hollow cylinder or drum of the same outside diameter as
the steining, supporting the ring within it and bevelled to a sharp
edge below. The rings, or ribs, of a wooden curb are formed of two
thicknesses of elm plank, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick by 9 inches wide, giving a
total thickness of 3 inches.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_054" id="i_054"></a>
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="600" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 19, 20.</p>
</div>

<p><a href="#i_052tb">Fig. 17</a> is a plan of a wooden drum curb, and <a href="#i_052tb">Fig. 18</a> a section showing
the mode of construction. The outside cylinder or drum is termed the
lagging, and is commonly made from 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch yellow pine planks. The
drum may be strengthened if necessary by additional rings, and its
connections with the rings made more secure by brackets. In large curbs
the rings are placed about 3 feet 6 inches apart. <a href="#i_054">Fig. 19</a> is a plan,
and <a href="#i_054">Fig. 20</a> an enlarged segment of an iron curb. When the well has been
sunk as far as the earth will stand vertical, the drum curb is lowered
into it and the building of the brick cylinder commenced, care being
taken to complete each course of bricks before laying another, in order
that the curb may be loaded equally all round. The earth is dug away
from the interior of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the drum, and this, together with the gradually increasing load, causes
the sharp lower edge of the drum to sink into the earth; and thus the
digging of the well at the bottom, the sinking of the drum curb and
the brick lining which it carries, and the building of the steining at
the top, go on together. Care must be taken in this, as in every other
method, to regulate the digging so that the well shall sink vertically.
Should the friction of the earth against the outside of the well at
length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> become so great as to stop its descent before the requisite
depth is attained, a smaller well may be sunk in the interior of the
first well. A well so stopped is said to be earth-fast. This plan
cannot be applied to deep wells, but is very successful in sandy soils
where the well is of moderate depth.</p>

<p>The curbs are often supported by iron rods, fitted with screws and
nuts, from cross timbers over the mouth of the well, and as the
excavation is carried on below, brickwork is piled on above, and the
weight of the steining will carry it down as the excavation proceeds,
until the friction of the sides overpowers the gravitating force or
weight of the steining, when it becomes earth-bound; then a set-off
must be made in the well, and the same operation repeated as often as
the steining becomes earth-bound, or the work must be completed by the
first method of underpinning.</p>

<p>When the rock to be sunk through is unstratified, or if stratified,
when of great thickness, recourse must be had to the action of
explosive agents. The explosives most frequently used for this purpose
are guncotton, dynamite, lithofracteur, and gunpowder. Lithofracteur is
now often employed, and always with considerable success, as its power
is similar to that of dynamite, but, what is particularly important in
vertical bore-holes, its action is intensely local; it is, moreover,
safe, does not generate fumes more harmful than ordinary gunpowder,
requires smaller holes, and but little tamping. The dangerous character
of guncotton has hitherto prevented its adoption for ordinary
operations, while the comparatively safe character and convenient form
of gunpowder have commended it to the confidence of workmen, and hence
for sinking operations this explosive is generally employed. We shall
therefore, in treating of blasting for well sinking, consider these
operations as carried out by the aid of gunpowder alone.</p>

<p>The system of blasting employed in well sinking is that known as
the small-shot system, which consists in boring holes from 1 to 3
inches diameter in the rock to be disrupted to receive the charge.
The position of these holes is a matter of the highest importance
from the point of view of producing the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> effects with the
available means, and to determine them properly requires a complete
knowledge of the nature of the forces developed by an explosive agent.
This knowledge is rarely possessed by sinkers. Indeed, such is the
ignorance of this subject displayed by quarrymen generally, that when
the proportioning and placing the charges are left to their judgment, a
large expenditure of labour and material will produce very inadequate
results. In all cases it is far more economical to entrust these duties
to one who thoroughly understands the subject. The following principles
should govern all operations of this nature.</p>

<p>The explosion of gunpowder, by the expansion of the gases suddenly
evolved, develops an enormous force, and this force, due to
the pressure of a fluid, is exerted equally in all directions.
Consequently, the surrounding mass subjected to this force will yield,
if it yield at all, in its weakest part, that is, in the part which
offers least resistance. The line along which the mass yields, or
line of rupture, is called the line of least resistance, and is the
distance traversed by the gases before reaching the surface. When the
surrounding mass is uniformly resisting, the line of least resistance
will be a straight line, and will be the shortest distance from the
centre of the charge to the surface. Such, however, is rarely the
case, and the line of rupture will therefore in most instances be an
irregular line, and often much longer than that from the centre direct
to the surface. Hence in all blasting operations there will be two
things to determine, the line of least resistance and the quantity of
powder requisite to overcome the resistance along that line. For it
is obvious that all excess of powder is waste; and, moreover, as the
force developed by this excess must be expended upon something, it will
probably be employed in doing mischief. Charges of powder of uniform
strength produce effects varying with their weight, that is, a double
charge will move a double mass. And as homogeneous masses vary as the
cube of any similar line within them, the general rule is established
that charges of powder to produce similar results are to each other
as the cubes of the lines of least resistance. Hence when the charge
requisite to produce a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> effect in a particular substance has
been determined by experiment, that necessary to produce a like effect
in a given mass of the same substance may be readily determined. As
the substances to be acted upon are various and differ in tenacity in
different localities, and as, moreover, the quality of powder varies
greatly, it will be necessary, in undertaking sinking operations, to
make experiments in order to determine the constant which should be
employed in calculating the charges of powder. In practice, the line of
least resistance is taken as the shortest distance from the centre of
the charge to the surface of the rock, unless the existence of natural
divisions shows it to lie in some other direction; and, generally, the
charge requisite to overcome the resistance will vary from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub>
of the cube of the line, the latter being taken in feet and the former
in pounds. Thus, suppose the material to be blasted is chalk, and the
line of least resistance 4 feet, the cube of 4 is 64, and taking the
proportion for chalk as <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub>, we have <sup>64</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> &#61; 2<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> lb. as the charge
necessary to produce disruption.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_058" id="i_058"></a>
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" width="47" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 21.</p>
</div>

<p>When the blasting is in stratified rock, the position of the charge
will frequently be determined by the natural divisions and fissures;
for if these are not duly taken into consideration, the sinker will
have the mortification of finding, after his shot has been fired, that
the elastic gases have found an easier vent through one of these flaws,
and that consequently no useful effect has been produced. The line of
least resistance, in this case, will generally be perpendicular to
the beds of the strata, so that the hole for the charge may be driven
parallel to the strata and in such a position as not to touch the
planes which separate them. This hole should never be driven in the
direction of the line of least resistance, and when practicable should
be at right-angles to it.</p>

<p>The instruments employed in boring the holes for the shot are iron rods
having a wedge-shaped piece of steel welded to their lower ends and
brought to an edge so as to cut into the rock. These are worked either
by striking them on the head with a hammer, or by jumping them up and
down and allowing them to penetrate by their own weight. When used in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> former manner they are called borers or drills; in the latter
case they are of the form <a href="#i_058">Fig. 21</a>, and are termed jumpers. Recently
power jumpers worked by compressed air, and drills actuated in the
same manner have been very successfully employed. Holes may be made by
these instruments in almost any direction; but when hand labour only is
available, the vertical can be most advantageously worked. Hand-jumpers
are usually about 4 feet 8 inches in length, and are used by holding
in the direction of the required hole, and producing a series of sharp
blows through lifting the tool about a foot high and dropping it with
an impulsive movement. The bead divides a jumper into two unequal
lengths, of which the shorter is used for commencing a bore-hole, and
the longer for finishing it. Often the bit on the long length is made a
trifle smaller than the other to remove any chance of its not following
into the hole which has been commenced.</p>

<p>Drills and jumpers should be made of the best iron, preferably Swedish,
for if the material be of an inferior quality it will split and turn
over under the repeated blows of the mall, and thus endanger the hands
of the workman who turns it, or give off splinters that may cause
serious injury to those engaged in the shaft. Frequently they are made
entirely of steel, and this material has much to recommend it for this
purpose; the length of drills varies from 18 inches to 4 feet, the
different lengths being put in successively as the sinking of the hole
progresses. The cutting edge of the drills should be well steeled, and
for the first, or 18-inch drill, have generally a breadth of 2 inches;
the second, or 28-inch drill, may be 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch on the edge; the third,
or 3-foot drill, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch, and the fourth, or 4-foot drill, 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_060" id="i_060"></a>
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" width="172" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 22.</p>
</div>

<p>The mode of using the drill in the latter case is as follows; The place
for the hole having been marked off with the pick, one man sits down
holding the drill in both hands between his legs. Another man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> then
strikes the drill with a mall, the former turning the drill partially
round between each blow to prevent the cutting edge from falling twice
in the same place.</p>

<p>The speed with which holes may be sunk varies of course with the
hardness of the rock and the diameter of the hole. At Holyhead the
average work done by three men in hard quartz rock with 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch
drills was 14 inches an hour; one man holding the drill, and two
striking. In granite of good quality, it has been ascertained by
experience that three men are able to sink with a 3-inch jumper 4
feet in a day; with a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch jumper, 5 feet; with a 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch, 6
feet; with a 2-inch, 8 feet; and with a 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-inch, 12 feet. A strong
man with a 1-inch jumper will bore 8 feet in a day. The weight of the
hammers used with drills is a matter deserving attention; for if too
heavy they fatigue the men, and consequently fewer blows are given and
the effect produced lessened; while, on the other hand, if too light,
the strength of the workman is not fully employed. The usual weight is
from 5 to 7 lb.</p>

<p>As the labour of boring a shot-hole in a given kind of rock is
dependent on the diameter, it is obviously desirable to make the hole
as small as possible, due regard being had to the size of the charge;
for it must be borne in mind in determining the diameter of the boring
that the charge should not occupy a great length in it. Various
expedients have been resorted to for the purpose of enlarging the hole
at the bottom so as to form a chamber for the powder. If this could
be easily effected, such a mode of placing the charge would be highly
advantageous, as a very small bore-hole would be sufficient, and the
difficulties of tamping much lessened. One of these expedients is to
place a small charge at the bottom of the bore and to fire it after
being properly tamped. The charge being insufficient to cause fracture,
the parts in immediate contact with it are compressed and crushed to
dust, and the cavity is thereby enlarged. The proper charge may then
be inserted in the chamber thus formed by boring through the tamping.
Another method, applicable chiefly to calcareous rock, has been tried
with satisfactory results at Marseilles. When the bore-hole has been
sunk to the required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> depth, a copper pipe, <a href="#i_060">Fig. 22</a>, of a diameter to
fit the bore loosely, is introduced, the end A reaching to the bottom
of the hole, which is closed up tight at B with clay so that no air may
escape. The pipe is provided with a bent neck C. A small leaden pipe
<i>e</i>, about half an inch in diameter, with a funnel <i>f</i> at the top, is
introduced into the copper pipe at D and passed down to within about
an inch of the bottom. The annular space between the leaden and copper
pipes at <i>g</i> is filled with a packing of hemp. Dilute nitric acid is
then poured through the funnel and leaden pipe. The acid dissolves
the calcareous rock at the bottom, causing an effervescence, and a
substance containing the dissolved lime is forced out of the orifice C.
This process is continued until from the quantity of acid consumed it
is judged that the chamber is sufficiently enlarged. Other acids, such
as muriatic or sulphuric, will produce the same effects, but the result
of the chemical solution will of course depend upon the nature of the
stone.</p>

<p>After the shot-hole has been bored, it is cleaned out and dried with
a wisp of hay, and the powder poured down; or, when the hole is not
vertical, pushed in with a wooden rammer. The quantity of powder should
always be determined by weight. One pound, when loosely poured out,
will occupy about 30 cubic inches, and 1 cubic foot weighs 57 pounds.
A hole 1 inch in diameter will therefore contain &#183;414 ounce for every
inch of depth. Hence to find the weight of powder to an inch of depth
in any given hole, we have only to multiply &#183;414 ounce by the square
of the diameter of the hole in inches, and we are enabled to determine
either the length of hole for a given charge, or the charge in a given
space. It is important to use strong powder in blasting operations,
because, as a smaller quantity will be sufficient, it will occupy less
space, and thereby save labour in boring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_061" id="i_061"></a>
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 23-25.</p>
</div>

<p>When the hole is in wet stone, means must be provided for keeping
the powder dry. For this purpose, tin cartridges are sometimes used.
These are tin cylinders of suitable dimensions, fitted with a small
tin stem through which the powder is ignited. The effect of the powder
is, however, much lessened by the use of these tin cases. Generally a
paper cartridge, well greased to prevent the water from penetrating,
will give far more satisfactory results. When the paper shot is used,
the hole should, previous to the insertion of the charge, be partially
filled with stiff clay, and a round iron bar, called a clay-iron or
bull, <a href="#i_061">Figs. 24, 25</a>, driven down to force the clay into the interstices
of the rock through which the water enters. By this means the hole
will be kept comparatively dry. The bull is withdrawn by placing a bar
through the eye near the top of the former, provided for that purpose,
and lifting it straight out. The cartridge is placed upon the point of
a pricker and pushed down the hole. The pricker, shown in <a href="#i_061">Fig. 23</a>, is a
taper piece of metal, usually of copper to prevent accidents, pointed
at one end and having a ring at the other. When the cartridge has been
placed in its position by this means, a little oakum is laid over it,
and a Bickford fuse inserted. This fuse is inexpensive, very certain
in its effects, not easily injured by tamping, and is unaffected by
moisture. The No. 8 fuse is preferred for wet ground; and when it is
required to fire the charge from the bottom in deep holes, No. 18 is
the most suitable.</p>

<p>When the line of least resistance has been decided upon, care must be
taken that it remains the line of least resistance; for if the space
in bore-hole is not properly filled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> the elastic gases may find an
easier vent in that direction than in any other. The materials employed
to fill this space are, when so applied, called tamping, and they
consist of the chips and dust from the sinking, sand, well-dried clay,
or broken brick or stones. Various opinions are held concerning the
relative value of these materials as tamping. Sand offers very great
resistance from the friction of the particles amongst themselves and
against the sides of the bore-hole; it may be easily applied by pouring
it in, and is always readily obtainable. Clay, if thoroughly baked,
offers a somewhat greater resistance than sand, and, where readily
procurable, may be advantageously employed. Broken stone is much
inferior to either of these substances in resisting power. The favour
in which it is held by sinkers and quarrymen, and the frequent use they
make of it as tamping, must be attributed to the fact of its being
always ready to hand, rather than to any excellent results obtained
from its use. The tamping is forced down with a stemmer or tamping bar
similar to <a href="#i_062">Figs. 26, 27</a>, too frequently made of iron, but which should
be either of copper or bronze. The tamping end of the bar is grooved
on one side, to admit of its clearing the pricker, or the fuse, lying
along the side of the hole. The other end is left plain for the hand or
for being struck with a hammer.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_062" id="i_062"></a>
<img src="images/i_062.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="72" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 26, 27.</p>
</div>

<p>All tamping should be selected for its freedom from particles likely
to strike fire, but it must not be overlooked that the cause of such
a casualty may lie in the sides of the hole itself. Under these
circumstances is seen the advisability of using bronze or copper
tamping tools, and of not hammering violently on the tamping until
a little of it has been first gently pressed down to cover over the
charge, because the earlier blows on the tamping are the most dangerous
in the event of a spark occurring. A little wadding, tow, paper, or
a wooden plug is sometimes put to lie against the charge before any
tamping is placed in the hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_063a" id="i_063a"></a>
<img src="images/i_063a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="325" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 28.</p>
</div>

<p>To lessen the danger of the tamping being blown out, plugs or cones of
metal of different shapes are sometimes inserted in the hole. The best
forms of plug are shown in Figs. 28 and 29; <a href="#i_063a">Fig. 28</a> is a metal cone
wedged in on the tamping with arrows, and <a href="#i_063b">Fig. 29</a> is a barrel-shaped
plug.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the sinkers, with the exception of one man whose
duty it is to fire the charge, are either drawn out of the shaft, or
are removed to some place of safety. This man then, having ascertained
by calling and receiving a reply that all are under shelter, applies a
light to the fuse, shouts &#8220;Bend away,&#8221; or some equivalent expression,
and is rapidly drawn up the shaft.</p>

<p>To avoid shattering the walls of a shaft, no shot should be placed
nearer the side than 12 inches. The portion of stone next the wall
sides of the shaft left after blasting is removed by steel-tipped iron
wedges 7 or 8 inches in length. These wedges are applied by making a
small hole with the point of the pick and driving them in with a mall.
The sides may be then dressed as required with the pick.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_063b" id="i_063b"></a>
<img src="images/i_063b.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="231" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 29.</p>
</div>

<p>After some 30 or 40 feet have been sunk the air at the bottom of the
well may be very foul, especially in a well where blasting operations
are being carried on, or where there is any great escape of noxious
gases through fissures. Means must then be provided for applying at
the surface a small exhaust fan to which is attached lengths of tubing
extending down the well. Another good plan is to pass a 4 or 6 inch
pipe down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> well, bring it up with a long bend at surface, and
insert a steam jet; a brick chimney is frequently built over the upper
end of the pipe to increase the draught, and the lower end continued
down with flexible tubing. With either fan or steam jet, the foul air
being continuously withdrawn, fresh air will rush down in its place.
This is far better than dashing lime-water down the well, using a long
wooden pipe with a revolving caphead, or pouring down a vertical pipe
water which escaped at right-angles, the old expedients for freshening
the air in a well.</p>

<p>A means of increasing the yield of wells, which is frequently very
successful, is to drive small tunnels or headings from the bottom of
the well into the surrounding water-bearing stratum.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_064" id="i_064"></a>
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="255" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 30.</p>
</div>

<p>As an example, let <a href="#i_064">Fig. 30</a> represent a sectional plan of a portion of
the water-bearing stratum at the bottom of the shaft. This stratum is
underlaid by an impervious stratum, and, consequently, the water will
flow continuously through the former in the direction of the dip, as
shown by the arrow and the dotted lines. That portion of the stratum
to the rise of the shaft, S, which is included within vertical lines
tangent to the circle at the points <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, will be drained by the
shaft. The breadth of this portion will, however, be extended beyond
these lines by the relief to the lateral pressure afforded by the
shaft, which relief will cause the fillets of water to diverge from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their original course towards the shaft, as shown in the figure. Hence
the breadth of drainage ground will be <i>a b</i>, and it is evident that
the shaft, S, can receive only that water which descends towards it
through this space. But if tunnels be driven from the shaft along the
strike of the stratum, as at <i>m c</i>, <i>n d</i>, these tunnels will obviously
intercept the water which flows past the shaft. By this means the
drainage ground is extended from <i>a b</i> to <i>a&acute; b&acute;</i>, and the yield of the
well proportionately increased.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_067tb" id="i_067tb"></a>
<img src="images/i_067tb.jpg" alt="" width="115" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 31-33.</p>
<p class="largeimg"><a href="images/i_067.jpg">Larger image</a> (224 kB)</p>
</div>

<p>It should be remarked that when the strata is horizontal or depressed
in the form of a basin, that is, when it partakes more of the character
of a <i>reservoir</i> than a <i>stream</i>, the only use of tunnels is to
facilitate the ingress of water into the shaft, and in such case they
should radiate from the shaft in all directions. They are also of
service in case of accident to the pumps, as the time they take to fill
up allows of examination and repairs being made in that time to the
pumps, which could not be got at if the engines stopped pumping and the
water rose rapidly up the shaft.</p>

<p>The size of the headings is usually limited by the least dimensions of
the space in which miners can work efficiently, that is about 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
feet high and 3 feet wide. The horse-shoe form is generally adopted
for the sides and top, the floor being level, for the drawing off of
the water by the pumps is quite sufficient to cause a flow, unless
of course the dip of the stratum in which the tunnels are driven is
such as to warrant an inclination. Where there is any water it is not
possible to drive them with a fall, for the men would be drowned out.</p>

<p>The cost of some headings in the new red sandstone which the writer
recently inspected, varied from 30<i>s.</i> a yard in ordinary stone, to
4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a yard in very hard stone.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks do not apply to headings driven in the chalk,
where it is the usual practice to select the largest feeder issuing
from a fissure and follow that fissure up, unless the heading is merely
to serve as a reservoir, when the direction is immaterial.</p>

<p>The sides of wells usually require lining or steining, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
termed, with some material that will prevent the loose strata of the
sides of the excavation falling into the well and choking it. The
materials that have been successfully used in this work are brick,
stone, timber, and iron. Each description of material is suitable under
certain conditions, while in other positions it is objectionable.
Brickwork, which is universally used in steining wells in England,
not unfrequently fails in certain positions; through admitting impure
water when such water is under great pressure, or from the work
becoming disjointed from settlement due to the draining of a running
sand-bed, or the collapse of the well. Stone of fair quality, capable
of withstanding compressive strains, is good in its way; but, inasmuch
as it requires a great deal of labour to fit it for its place, it
cannot successfully compete with brickwork in the formation of wells,
more especially as it has no merits superior to those of brick when
used in such work; however, if in any locality, by reason of its
cheapness, it can be used, care should be taken to select only such as
contains a large amount of silica; indeed, in all cases it is a point
of great importance in studying the nature of the materials used in
the construction of wells, to select those which are likely to be the
most durable, and at the same time preserve the purity of the water
contained in the well; and this is best secured by silicious materials.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_068a" id="i_068a"></a>

</div>

<p>Timber is objectionable as a material to be used in the lining of
wells, on account of its liability to decay, when it not only endangers
the construction of the well, but also to some extent fouls the water.
It is very largely used under some circumstances, especially in the
preliminary operations in sinking most wells. It is also successfully
used in lining the shafts of the salt wells of Cheshire, and will
continue entire in such a position for a great number of years, as the
brine seems to have a tendency to preserve the timber and prevent its
decay. Iron is of modern application, and is a material extensively
employed in steining wells; and, as it possesses many advantages over
materials ordinarily used, its use is likely to be much extended. It
is capable of bearing great compressive strains, and of effectually
excluding the influx of all such waters as it may be desirable to keep
out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> is not liable to decay under ordinary circumstances. Baldwin
Latham mentions instances in his practice where recourse has been had
to the use of iron cylinders, when it was found that four or five rings
of brickwork, set in the best cement, failed to keep out brackish
waters; and, if the original design had provided for the introduction
of these cylinders, it would have reduced the cost of the well very
materially.</p>

<p>The well-sinker has often, in executing his work, to contend with
the presence of large volumes of water, which, under ordinary
circumstances, must be got rid of by pumping; but by the introduction
of iron cylinders, which can be sunk under water, the consequent
expense of pumping is saved.</p>

<p>When sinking these cylinders through water-bearing strata, various
tools are used to remove the soil from beneath them. The principal is
the mizer, which consists of an iron cylinder with an opening on the
side and a cutting lip, and which is attached to a set of boring rods
and turned from above.</p>

<p>The valve in the old form of mizer is subject to various accidents
which interfere with the action of the tool; for instance, pieces of
hard soil or rock often lodge between the valve and its seat, allowing
the contents to run out whilst it is being raised through water. To
remedy this defect the eminent well-sinker, Thomas Docwra, designed and
introduced the improved mizer, shown of the usual dimensions in Figs.
31 to 36; <a href="#i_067tb">Fig. 31</a> being a plan at top, <a href="#i_067tb">Fig. 32</a> an elevation, <a href="#i_067tb">Fig. 33</a> a
plan at bottom, <a href="#i_068a">Fig. 35</a> a section, <a href="#i_068a">Fig. 34</a> a plan of the stop <i>a</i>, and
<a href="#i_068a">Fig. 36</a> a plan of the valve. It consists of an iron cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> conical
shaped at bottom, furnished with holes for the escape of water, and
attached to a central shank by means of stays. The shank extends some
7 inches beyond the bottom, and ends in a point, while the upper part
of the shank has an open slot, to form a box-joint, <a href="#i_068b">Figs. 37 to 39</a>,
with the rods. The conical bottom of the mizer has a triangular-shaped
opening; on the outside of this is fitted a strong iron cutter, and on

35 and 36</a>. When the mizer is attached to and turned by means of the
boring rods, the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, sand, or other soil to be removed, being
turned up by the lip of the cutter, enters the cylinder, the valve,
whilst the mizer is filling, resting against a stop. After the mizer
is charged, which can be ascertained by placing a mark upon the last
rod at surface and noting its progress downwards, the rods are reversed
and turned once or twice in a backward direction; this forces the valve
over the opening and retains the soil safely in the tool.</p>

<a href="#i_069a">Fig. 42</a> indicating its correct position when in operation, is employed
where the strata is too irregular or compact to be effectually cleared
away by the cutter of the mizer. The picker is fixed upon the same rods
above the mizer, and is used simultaneously, being raised and lowered
with that tool.</p>

<p>The cutting end of the picker is frequently replaced by a scratcher,
<a href="#i_069b">Figs. 44, 45</a>. This useful tool rakes or scratches up the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
thrown by the mizer beyond its own working range, and causes it to

the action of the mizer.</p>

48</a> for 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches. The bricks are laid flat, breaking joint; and
to keep out moderate land-springs clay, puddle, or concrete is often
introduced at the back of the steining; for most purposes concrete is
the best, as, in addition to its impervious character, it adds greatly
to the strength of the steining. A ring or two of brickwork in cement
is often introduced at intervals, varying from 5 feet to 12 feet apart,
to strengthen the shaft, and facilitate the construction of the well.</p>

<p>Too much care cannot be bestowed upon the steining; if properly
executed it will effectually exclude all objectionable infiltration,
but badly made, it may prove a permanent source of trouble and
annoyance. Half the wells condemned on account of sewage contamination
really fail because of bad steining.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<span class="small">WELL BORING.</span></h2>

<p>The first method of well boring known in Europe is that called the
Chinese, in which a chisel suspended by a rope and surrounded by a
tube of a few feet in length is worked up and down by means of a
spring-pole or lever at the surface. The twisting and untwisting of the
rope prevents the chisel from always striking in the same place; and
by its continued blows the rock is pounded and broken. The chisel is
withdrawn occasionally, and a bucket or shell-pump is lowered, having a
hinged valve at the bottom opening upwards, so that a quantity of the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> becomes enclosed in the bucket, and is then drawn up by it to
the surface; the lowering of the bucket is repeated until the hole is
cleared, and the chisel is then put to work again.</p>

<p><a href="#i_072">Fig. 49</a> is of an apparatus, on the Chinese system, which may be used
either for hemp-rope or wire-rope, and which was originally made for
hoop-iron. At A, <a href="#i_072">Fig. 49</a>, is represented a log of oak wood, which is
set perpendicularly so deep in the ground as to penetrate the loose
gravel and pass a little into the rock, and stand firm in its place; it
is well rammed with gravel and the ground levelled, so that the butt of
the log is flush with the surface of the ground, or a few feet below.
Through this log, which may be, according to the depth of loose ground,
from 5 feet to 30 feet long, a vertical hole is bored by an auger of a
diameter equal to that of the intended boring in the rock. On the top
of the ground, on one side of the hole, is a windlass whose drum is 5
feet in diameter, and the cogwheel which drives it 6 feet; the pinion
on the crank axle is 6 inches. This windlass serves for hoisting the
spindle or drill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> and is of a large diameter, in order to prevent
short bends in the iron, which would soon make it brittle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_072" id="i_072"></a>
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 49.</p>
</div>

<p>In all cases where iron, either hoop-iron or wire-rope, is used, the
diameter of the drum of the windlass used must be sufficiently large
to prevent a permanent bend in the iron. On the opposite side of the
windlass is a lever of unequal leverage, about one-third at the side
of the hole, and two-thirds at the opposite side, where it ends in
a cross or broad end where men do the work. The workmen, with one
foot on a bench or platform, rest their hands on a railing, and work
with the other foot the long end of the lever. In this way the whole
weight of the men is made use of. The lift of the bore-bit is from 10
to 12 inches, which causes the men to work the treadle from 20 to 24
inches high. Below the treadle, T, is a spring-pole, S, fastened under
the platform on which the men stand, the end of this spring-pole is
connected by a link to the working end of the lever, or to the rope
directly, and pulls the treadle down. When the bore-spindle is raised
by means of the treadle, the spring-pole imparts to it a sudden return,
and increases by these means the velocity of the bit, and consequently
that of the stroke downwards.</p>

<p>This method has been generally disused, iron or wood rods substituted
in the place of the rope, and a variety of augers and chisels instead
of the simple chisel, with appliances for clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> the bore-hole
of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. <a href="#i_074">Figs. 50 to 56</a> show examples of an ordinary set of
well boring tools. <a href="#i_074">Fig. 52</a> is a flat chisel; <a href="#i_074">Fig. 53</a> a <span class="symb">V</span>-chisel; and
<a href="#i_074">Fig. 54</a> a <span class="symb">T</span>-chisel. These chisels are made from wrought-iron, and
when small are usually 18 inches long, 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches extreme breadth,
and weigh some 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> lb.; the cutting edge being faced with the best
steel. They are used for hard rocks, and whilst in operation need
carefully watching that they may be removed and fresh tools substituted
when their sides are sufficiently worn to diminish their breadth. If
this circumstance is not attended to the size of the hole decreases,
so that when a new chisel of the proper size is introduced it will
not pass down to the bottom of the hole, and much unnecessary delay
is occasioned in enlarging it. In working with the chisel, the borer
keeps the tiller, or handles, in both hands, one hand being placed upon
each handle, and moves slowly round the bore, in order to prevent the
chisel from falling twice, successively, in the same place, and thus
preserve the bore circular. Every time a fresh chisel is lowered to the
bottom it should be worked round in the hole, to test whether it is
its proper size and shape; if this is not the case the chisel must be
raised at once and worked gradually and carefully until the hole is as
it should be. The description of strata being cut by the chisel can be
ascertained with considerable accuracy by a skilful workman from the
character of the shock transmitted to the rods.</p>

<p>When working in sandstone there is no adherence of the rock to the
chisel when drawn to the surface, but with clays the contrary is the
case. Should the stratum be very hard, the chisel may be worn and blunt
before cutting three quarters of an inch, it must therefore be raised
to the surface and frequently examined; however, 7 or 8 inches may be
bored without examination, should the nature of the stratum allow of
such progress being made.</p>

</div>

<p>Ground augers, <a href="#i_074">Figs. 50, 51, and 56</a>, are similar in action to those
used for boring wood, but differ in shape and construction. The common
earth auger, <a href="#i_074">Fig. 50</a>, is 3 feet in length, having the lower two-thirds
cylindrical. The bottom is partially closed by the lips, and there is
an opening a little up one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
side for the admission of soft or bruised material. Augers are only
used for penetrating soft rock, clay, and sand; and their shape is
varied to suit the nature of the strata traversed, being open and
cylindrical for clays having a certain degree of cohesion, conical,
and sometimes closed, in quicksands. Augers are sometimes made as long
as 10 feet, and are then very effective if the strata is soft enough
to permit of their use. The shell is made from 3 feet to 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet in
length, of nearly the same shape as the common auger, sometimes closed
to the bottom, <a href="#i_074">Fig. 56</a>, or with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> auger nose, <a href="#i_074">Fig. 51</a>; in either case
there is a clack or valve placed inside for the purpose of retaining
borings of a soft nature or preventing them from being washed out in a
wet hole. <a href="#i_075a">Fig. 59</a> shows a wad-hook for withdrawing stones, and <a href="#i_075a">Fig. 58</a>
a worm-auger.</p>

<p>The Crow&#8217;s Foot, <a href="#i_074">Fig. 55</a>, is used when the boring rods have broken in
the bore-hole, for the purpose of extracting that portion remaining in
the hole; it is the same length, and at the foot the same breadth as
the chisels. When the rods have broken, the part above the fracture
is drawn out of the bore-hole and the crow&#8217;s foot screwed on in place
of the broken piece; when this is lowered down upon the broken rod,
by careful twisting the toe is caused to grip the broken piece with
sufficient force to allow the portion below the fracture to be drawn
out of the bore-hole. A rough expedient is to fasten a metal ring to
a rope and lower it over the broken rod, when the rod cants the ring,
and thus gives it a considerable grip; this is often very successful.
<a href="#i_075a">Fig. 57</a> is a worm used for the same purpose. A bell-box, <a href="#i_075b">Fig. 60</a>, is
frequently employed for drawing broken rods; it has two palls fixed at
the top of the box, which rise and permit the end of the rod to pass
when the box is lowered, but upon raising it the palls fall and grip
the rod firmly. A spiral angular worm, similar to <a href="#i_075a">Fig. 57</a>, is also
applied for withdrawing tubes.</p>

<p>Of these withdrawing tools the crow is the safest and best, as it
may be used without that intelligent supervision and care absolutely
necessary with the worms and wad-hooks, or the bell-box.</p>

<p>The boring rods, <a href="#i_076a">Figs. 61, 62</a>, are in 3, 6, 10, 15, or 20 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lengths, of wrought-iron, preferably Swedish, and are made of different
degrees of strength according to the depth of the hole for which they
are required; they are generally 1 inch square in section: at one
end is a male and at the other end a female screw for the purpose of
connecting them together. The screw should not have fewer than six
threads. One of the sides of the female screw frequently splits and
allows the male screw to be drawn out, thus leaving the rods in the
hole. By constant wear, also, the screw may have its thread so worn as
to become liable to slip. Common rods being most liable to accident
should be carefully examined every time they are drawn out of the
bore-hole, as an unobserved failure may occasion much inconvenience,
and even the loss of the bore-hole. In addition to the ordinary rods
there are short pieces, varying from 6 inches to 2 feet in length,
which are fixed at the top, as required, for adjusting the rods at a
convenient height.</p>

<p>Lining tubes are employed to prevent the bore-hole falling in through
the lateral swelling of clay strata, or when passing through running
sand. The tubes are usually of iron, of good quality, soft, easily
bent, and capable of sustaining an indent without fracture. Inferior
tubes occasion grave and costly accidents which are frequently
irreparable, as a single bad tube may endanger the success of an entire
boring.</p>

<p>Wrought-iron tubes with screwed flush joints, <a href="#i_077b">Fig. 68</a>, are to be
recommended, but they are supplied brazed, <a href="#i_077b">Fig. 69</a>, or riveted, <a href="#i_077b">Fig.
70</a>, and can be fitted with steel driving collars and shoes. Cast-iron
tubes are constantly applied; they should have turned ends with
wrought-iron collars and countersunk screws.</p>

<p>Cold-drawn wrought-iron tubes have been used, and are very effective as
well as easily applied, but their relatively high cost occasions their
application to be limited.</p>

<p><a href="#i_077b">Fig. 71</a> shows a stud-block, which is used for suspending tubing either
for putting it down or for drawing it up. It consists of a block made
to fit inside the end of the tube, and attached to the rods in the
usual way. In the side of the block is fixed an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> iron stud for slipping
into a slot, similar to a bayonet-joint, cut in the end of the tube,
so that it may be thus suspended. <a href="#i_078">Figs. 72 to 74</a> show various forms of
spring-darts, and <a href="#i_078">Fig. 75</a> a pipe-dog, for the same purpose. Sometimes a
conical plug, with a screw cut around the outside for tightening itself
in the upper end of the tube, is used for raising and lowering tubing.
<a href="#i_078">Figs. 76 and 77</a> are of tube clamps, and <a href="#i_078">Fig. 78</a> tongs for screwing up
the tubes. <a href="#i_078">Fig. 79</a> is of an ordinary form of sinker&#8217;s bucket.</p>

<p><a href="#i_079a">Fig. 80</a> is a pipe-dolly, used for driving the lining tubes; the figure
shows it in position ready for driving.</p>

<p>When a projection in the bore-hole obstructs the downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> course of
the lining tubes, the hole can be enlarged below the pipes by means of
a rimer, <a href="#i_079a">Fig. 81</a>. It consists of an iron shank, to which is bolted two
thin strips, bowed out in to the form of a drawing pen. The rimer is
screwed on to the boring rods, and forced down through the pipes; when
below the last length of pipe the rimer expands, and can then be turned
round, which has the effect of scraping the sides and enlarging that
portion of the hole subject to its operation. <a href="#i_079b">Fig. 82</a> is of an improved
form of rimer, termed a riming spring. It will be seen that this
instrument is much stronger than the ordinary rimer, in consequence of
the shank being extended through its entire length, thus rendering the
scraping action of the bows very effective, whilst the slot at the foot
of the bows permits of its introduction into, and withdrawal from, the
tubing.</p>

<p>In England, for small works, the entire boring apparatus is frequently
arranged as in <a href="#i_080">Fig. 83</a>, the tool being fixed at the end of the
wrought-iron rods instead of at the end of a rope, as in the Chinese
method. Referring to <a href="#i_080">Fig. 83</a>, A is the boring tool; B the rod to
which the tool is attached; D D the levers by which the men E E give
a circular or rotating motion to the tool; F, chain for attaching the
boring apparatus to the pole G, which is fixed at H, and by its means
the man at I transmits a vertical motion to the boring tool.</p>

<p>The sheer-legs, made of sound Norway spars not less than 8 inches
diameter at the bottom, are placed over the bore-hole for the purpose
of supporting the tackle K K for drawing the rods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>out of or lowering them into the hole, when
it is advisable to clean out the hole or renew the chisel. It is
obvious that the more frequently it is necessary to break the joints
in drawing and lowering the rods, the more time will be occupied in
changing the chisels, or in each cleaning of the hole, and as the
depth of the hole increases the more tedious will the operation be. It
therefore becomes of much importance that the rods should be drawn and
lowered as quickly as possible, and to attain this end as long lengths
as practicable should be drawn at each lift. The length of the lift
or off-take, as it is termed, depending altogether upon the height of
the lifting tackle above the top of the bore-hole, the length of the
sheer-legs for a hole of any considerable depth should not be less than
30 to 40 feet; and they usually stand over a small pit or surface-well,
which may be sunk, where the clay or gravel is dry, to a depth of 20 or
30 feet. From the bottom of this pit the bore-hole may be commenced,
and here will be stationed the man who has charge of the bore-hole
while working the rods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 84.</p>
</div>

<p>The arrangement, <a href="#i_082">Fig. 84</a>, is intended for either deep or difficult
boring. A regular scaffolding is erected upon which a platform is
built. The boring chisel A is, as in the last instance, coupled by
means of screw-couplings to the boring rods B. At each stroke two men
stationed at E E turn the rod slightly by means of the tiller D D. A
rope F, which is attached to the boring tool, is passed a few times
round the drum of a windlass G, the end of the rope being held by a
man at I. When the handles are turned by the men at L L the man at I
pulls at the rope end, the friction between the rope and the drum of
the windlass is then sufficient to raise the rods and boring tool, but
as soon as the tool has been raised to its intended height the man at I
slackens his hold upon the rope, and as there is insufficient friction
on the drum to sustain the weight of the boring tools, they fall. By a
repetition of this operation the well is bored, and after it has been
continued a sufficient length of time the tiller is unscrewed, and a
lifting dog, attached to the rope from the windlass, is passed over the
top of the rods, and then a short top rod with a shackle is screwed on.
The two men at the windlass draw up the rods as far as the height of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>the scaffolding or sheer-legs will allow,
when a man at E, <a href="#i_082">Fig. 84</a>, by passing a hand-dog or a key upon the top
of the rod under the lowest joint drawn above the top of the hole,
takes the weight of the rods at this joint, the men at L having lowered
the rods for this purpose; with another key the rods are unscrewed
at this joint, the rope is lowered again, the lifting dog put over
the rod, another top rod screwed on, the rods lifted, and the process
continued until the chisel is drawn from the hole and replaced by
another, or, if necessary, replaced by some other tool.</p>

<p>When a deep boring is undertaken, direct from the surface, the
operation had best be conducted with the aid of a boring sheer-frame
such as is shown in the <a href="#i_005">frontispiece</a>. This consists of a framework of
timber balks, upon which are erected four standards, 27 feet in height,
and 9 inches &times; 1 foot thick, 3 feet 8 inches apart at bottom, and 1
foot 2 inches at top, as seen in the front and rear elevations. The
standards are tied by means of cross pieces, upon which shoulders are
cut which fit into mortise holes, and are fastened by means of wooden
keys, the standards being surmounted by two head pieces 5 feet long,
mortised and fitted. Upon the head pieces two independent cast-iron
guide pulleys are arranged in bearings; over these pulleys are led the
ends of two ropes coiling in opposite directions upon the barrel of
a windlass moved by spur gearing, and having a ratchet stop attached
to a pair of diagonal timbers, connected with the left-hand legs or
standards of the sheers, near the ground. These ropes are used for
raising or lowering the lengths of the boring rod.</p>

<p>Eight feet below the bearings of the top pulleys, a pair of horizontal
traverses is fixed across the frame, supporting smaller pulleys mounted
on a cast-iron frame, which is capable of motion between horizontal
wooden slides. Over these pulleys is led a rope from a plain windlass
fixed to the right-hand legs of the frame, to be used for raising or
lowering the shell to extract the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> or rubbish from the hole.</p>

<p>The lever, 15 feet long, and 9 inches &times; 6 inches in section, is
supported by an independent timber frame. It has a cast-iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> cap,
fastened by means of two iron straps, cast with lugs through which
bolts are passed, these being tightened with nuts in the ordinary
manner. The bearing-pins at <i>a</i> are 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch in diameter, and also form
part of the lower strap. Upon the cap is an iron hook, to this a chain
is attached carrying the spring-hook which bears the top shackle of the
rods. The top of the bore-hole is surrounded by a wooden tube 1 foot
in diameter, and surrounded by a hinged valve, whose action is similar
to that of a clack-valve; this has a hole in the centre for the rods
to pass up and down freely. The valve permits of the introduction and
withdrawal of the tools, and at the same time prevents anything from
above falling into the bore-hole.</p>

<p>The lever is applied by pressure upon its outer end, and as the
relation of the long to the short arm is as 4 to 1, a depression of 2
feet in the one case produces an elevation of 6 inches in the other,
the minimum range of action, the maximum being 26 inches.</p>

<p>With the sheer-frame the boring tools are worked in the same manner
as in the preceding arrangements, Figs. <a href="#i_080">83</a>, <a href="#i_082">84</a>; but its portability,
compactness, and adaptation of means to the required end, render its
use desirable wherever it is possible to obtain it.</p>

<p>When in the progress of the work it is found that the auger does not go
down to the depth from which it was withdrawn, after trial, tubing will
generally be necessary. The hole should be enlarged from the surface,
or, if not very deep, commenced afresh from the surface with a larger
auger, and run down to nearly the same depth; the first length of tube
is then driven into the hole, and when this is effected another tube,
having similar dimensions to the first, is screwed into its upper end,
and the driving repeated, and so on until a sufficient number of pipes
have been used to reach to the bottom of the hole. If the ordinary
auger is now introduced through these tubes it will have free access to
the clay or sand, and after a few feet deeper have been bored another
pipe may be screwed on, and the whole driven farther down. In this
way from 10 to 20 feet of soft stratum may be bored through. If the
thickness of the surface clay or sand is considerable the method here
mentioned will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be effective, as the friction of the pipes caused by the pressure
of the strata will be so great that perhaps not more than 80 or 100
feet can be driven without the pipes being injured. It will then be
necessary to put down the first part of the bore-hole with a large
auger, and drive in pipes of larger diameter; the hole is continued of
smaller diameter, and lined with smaller tubes projecting beyond the
large tubes, as in <a href="#i_085atb">Fig. 85</a>, until the necessity for their use ceases.
It will be evident that to ensure success the tubing, whatever it is
made of, should be as truly cylindrical as possible, straight, and
flush surface, both outside and in. It will also be evident that in
thus joining pieces of tubing together, the thickness ought to have a
due proportion to the work required, and the force likely to be used in
screwing or driving them down. Wrought-iron tubes, when driven, must be
worked carefully, by means of a ring made of wrought-iron, from 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
to 2 inches in height and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch thick, and of the form shown in <a href="#i_085b">Fig.
86</a>; or driven with a pipe-dolly such as that in <a href="#i_079a">Fig. 80</a>. The ring, or
the dolly, is screwed into the lowermost boring rod and worked at the
same rate and in a similar manner to the chisel, due regard being had
to the depth at which the driving is being done, as the weight of the
boring rods will materially affect the strength of the blow delivered.
Cast-iron tubing may be driven hard with a monkey. To withdraw broken
or defective tubing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> quickly, two hooks attached to ropes are lowered
down from opposite sides of the bore-hole, caught on the rim of the
lowermost tube, and power applied to haul the tubing up bodily.</p>

<p><a href="#i_086">Figs. 87 to 91</a> show good methods of forming tube or pipe joints both in
cast and wrought-iron, when not screwed.</p>

<p>P. S. Reed, an English mining engineer, gives the following instance
of replacing defective tubing in a boring which had been pursued to
the depth of 582<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet, but which, owing to circumstances which
were difficult to determine, had become very expensive, and made slow
progress.</p>

<p>The 582<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet had been bored entirely by manual labour; but Reid
recommended the erection of a horse-gin, in which the power was applied
to a 40-inch drum placed upon a vertical axle, the arms of which
admitted of applying two horses, and men at pleasure, the power gained
being in the proportion of one to ten at the starting-point for the
horses.</p>

<p>Upon the upright drum a double-ended chain was attached, which worked
over sheer-legs erected immediately over the hole, so as to attain an
off-take for the rods of 60 feet, and so as that, in the act of raising
or lowering, there might always be one end of the chain in the bottom,
ready to be attached, and expedite the work as much as possible.</p>

<p>These arrangements being made, it was soon found that there was a
defect in the tubing which was inserted to the depth of 109 feet, and
the defect was so serious, in permitting the sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> to descend and be
again brought up with the boring tools, as to render it very difficult
to tell in what strata they really were; this increased to such a
degree as to cause the silting up of the hole in a single night to the
extent of 180 feet, and it occupied nearly a fortnight in clearing the
hole out again.</p>

<p>On carefully examining into this defect, it appeared that the water
rose in the hole to the depth of 74 feet from the surface; and that at
this point it was about level with the high-water mark on the Tees,
about two miles distant, with which it was no doubt connected by means
of permeable beds, extending from the arenaceous strata at a depth of
100 feet.</p>

<p>On commencing to bore, the motion of the rods in the hole caused the
vibration of the water between a range of 40 feet at the bottom of the
tubing, and so disturbed the quiescent sand as to cause it to run down
through the faults in the lower end of the tubing.</p>

<p>This tubing was made of galvanized iron plates, riveted together and
soldered; at the top of the hole it was in three concentric circles,
which had been screwed and forced down successively until an obstacle
was met with at three different places. So soon as the outer circle
reached the first depth, all hope appears to have vanished, from those
who bored the earlier part of the work, of getting the tube farther; a
second tube was, therefore, inserted, which seems to have advanced as
far as the second obstacle, where it, in its turn, was abandoned; and a
third one advanced until it rested in the strata at the lower part of
the lias freestone of a blue nature, as found on the rocks at Seaton
Carew, and in the bed of the Leven, near Hutton Rudby. The diameter of
the first tubing was 3<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches external and 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches internal;
the second tube was 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches external, and 3 inches internal
diameter; and the third tube was 2<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches external and 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches
internal diameter.</p>

<p>Such being the account gathered from the workmen who superintended the
earlier part of the boring, it became necessary to decide upon the
best cause to remedy the evil. At first sight it would have appeared
easy enough to have caught the lower end of the tubes by means of a
fish-head properly contrived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> thus to have lifted them out of
the hole, and replaced them with a perfect tube, such as a gas-tube,
with faucet screw-joints; but, on attempting this, it soon became
evident that however good the tubing which might have been adopted,
it would be a work of the greatest difficulty to extract when once it
was regularly fixed and jammed into its place by the tenacious clayey
strata surrounding it; and the difficulty of extracting it, in the
present case, was even enhanced by the inferior quality and make of the
tubing; in short, that, unless by crumpling it up in such a manner as
to destroy the hole, it was impossible to extract this tubing by main
force.</p>

<p>There was, therefore, no other choice left but to attempt cutting it
out, inch by inch; though before doing so, force was applied to the
bottom of the tubing, to the extent of upwards of 30 tons, the only
result being the loss of several pieces of steel down the hole, which
had to be brought up with a powerful magnet.</p>

<p>After much mature consideration and contrivance, it was determined to
order such tubing as would at the same time present as little obstacle
as possible to the clay to be passed through on the outside, as well as
surround the largest of the three tubes then in the hole, and present
no obstacle to their being withdrawn through its interior.</p>

<p>These tubes were made 12 feet in length, flush outside and in, the
lower portion being steeled for 6 inches from the bottom end, so as to
cut its way and follow down the space, and cover that exposed by the
old tubes when cut and drawn, as shown in <a href="#i_089tb">Fig. 92</a>.</p>

<p>In order to commence operations, and avoid too much clay going down
to the bottom of the hole, a straw-plug was firmly fixed in the lias
portion of the hole. The lower portion of the new tubes was then
screwed around the old ones by means of powerful clamps, attached to
the exterior in such a manner as to avoid injuring the surface; and
when they could be screwed no farther, the knife or cutter, <a href="#i_089tb">Figs. 92
to 94</a>, was introduced inside the old tubing. Some force was needed to
get this knife down into the tubing, but the spring a giving so as to
accommodate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> itself to the hole, permitted its descent to the distance
required; this being effected, it was turned round so that the steel
cutter, shown at <i>b</i>, being forced against the sides of the tube, cut
it through in the course of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour&#8217;s
turning. See section at <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <a href="#i_089tb">Fig. 93</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_089tb" id="i_089tb"></a>

<p class="largeimg"><a href="images/i_089.jpg">Larger image</a> (125 kB)</p>
</div>

<p>The old tubes being three-ply, three of these knives or cutters were
required to cut out the three tubes, the inner one being detached
first, and then the two exterior ones; and so soon as these latter were
cut out as far as they had been forced into the clay, the work became
simplified into following down the interior tubing by the new tubes, as
shown by the dotted lines. From <i>d</i> at the lower end, it was found that
the old inner tube had been so damaged or torn, either by the putting
in or hammering it down, as to leave a vent or fissure for the sand to
descend, and thus spoil the whole of the work for all future success in
the boring, to say nothing of the very great cost of lifting the sand
out, and subsequent most arduous labour to put the hole right.</p>

<p>Boring was recommenced after about a month&#8217;s labour in taking out
the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> tubings, leaving the new ones firmly bedded into the lias
formation, 112 feet from the surface, and the hole was subsequently
bored to a depth of 710 feet in the new red sandstone formation,
proceeding at the rate of about 3 feet in the twelve hours, and leaving
the hole so as, if requisite, it might be widened out to 4 inches
diameter. <a href="#i_089tb">Fig. 92</a> shows the action of the knife and spring-cutter
when forced down into the tubing, ready to commence cutting. It also
shows the lower end of the new tubing, enclosing the others at the
commencement of the work. The joints of the new tubes were made by
means of a half-lap screw. <a href="#i_089tb">Fig. 94</a> is a back view of the knife or
cutter <i>b</i>. <a href="#i_089tb">Fig. 93</a> shows the action of the spring and cutter when the
requisite length is cut through and ready for lifting; the position
of the tube being maintained perpendicular, or nearly so, by the ball
or thickening on the rods at K, and the lower end of the tube being
supported by the projecting steel cutter at <i>b</i>, the dotted lines from
<i>d</i> showing the position of the new steel-ended tube when screwed down
ready for another operation. In boring deeper after the tubes were
removed, three wooden blocks were used round the rods in the new tube
to keep them plumb.</p>

<p>In some cases it is necessary to widen out holes below the sharp edge
of tubing, so as to permit its descent. This is effected with a rimer,
Figs. <a href="#i_079a">81</a> and <a href="#i_079b">82</a>, and is an operation requiring great care and attention.</p>

<p>To reduce the stoppages for the withdrawal of <i>d&eacute;bris</i> the system
of Fauvelle was introduced, but it is now very little practised on
the Continent, and not at all in Great Britain. The principles upon
which it was founded were: first, that the motion given to the tool
in rotation was simply derived from the resistance that a rope would
oppose to an effort of torsion; and therefore that the limits of
application of the system were only such as would provide that the
tool should be safely acted upon; and, secondly, that the injection
of a current of water, descending through a central tube, should
wash out the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> created by the cutting tool at the bottom. The
difficulties attending the removal of the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> were great; and
though the system of Fauvelle answered tolerably well when applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> to
shallow borings, it was found to be attended with such disadvantages
when applied on a large scale, that it has been generally abandoned.
The quantity of water required to keep the boring tool clear is a
great objection to the introduction of this system, especially as in
the majority of cases Artesian wells are sunk in such places as are
deprived of the advantage of a large supply.</p>

<p>In the ordinary system of well boring, innumerable breakages and delays
occur when a boring is required to be carried to any depth exceeding
200 or 300 feet, owing to the buckling of the rods, the crystallization
of the iron by the constant jarring at each blow, and particularly the
increased weight of the rods as the hole gets deeper. It follows from
this, that where the excavation is very deep, there is considerable
difficulty in transmitting the blow of the tool, in consequence of the
vibration produced in the long rod, or in consequence of the torsion;
and, for the same reason, there is a danger of the blows not being
equally delivered at the bottom. It has been attempted to obviate
this difficulty, but without much success, by the use of hollow rods,
presenting greater sectional area than was absolutely necessary for the
particular case, in order to increase their lateral resistance to the
blows tending to produce vibration.</p>

<p>Boring is usually executed by contract. The approximate average cost
in England may be taken at 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a foot for the first 30 feet;
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a foot for the second 30 feet; and continue in arithmetical
progression, advancing 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a foot for every additional 30 feet
in depth. This does not include the cost of tubing, conveyance of
plant and tools, professional superintendence, or working in rock of
unusual hardness, such as hard limestone and whinstone. A clause is
usually inserted in the contract, to the effect that, if any unforeseen
difficulty is met with in the course of the work, it is then paid for
by the day, at a rate previously determined upon, until the difficulty
has been overcome.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<span class="small">AMERICAN TUBE WELL.</span></h2>

<p>This well consists of a hollow wrought-iron tube about 1<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch
diameter, composed of any number of lengths from 3 to 11 feet,
according to the depth required. The water is admitted into the tube
through a series of holes, which extend up the lowest length to a
height of 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet from the bottom.</p>

<p>The position for a well having been selected, a vertical hole is made
in the ground with a crowbar to a convenient depth; the well tube <i>a</i>,
having the clamp <i>d</i>, monkey <i>c</i>, and pulleys <i>b</i>, <a href="#i_092">Fig. 95</a>, previously
fixed on it, is inserted into this hole.</p>

<p>The clamp is then screwed firmly on to the tube from 18 inches to 2
feet from the ground, as the soil is either difficult or easy; each
bolt being tightened equally, so as not to indent the tube.</p>

<p>The pulleys are next clamped on to the tube at a height of about 6 or 7
feet from the ground, the ropes from the monkey having been previously
rove through them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_092" id="i_092"></a>
<img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" width="115" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 95.</p>
</div>

<p>The monkey is raised by two men pulling the ropes at the same angle.
They should stand exactly opposite each other, and work together
steadily, so as to keep the tube perfectly vertical, and prevent it
from swaying about while being driven. If the tube shows an inclination
to slope towards one side, a rope should be fastened to its top and
kept taut on the opposite side, so as gradually to bring the tube back
to the vertical. When the men have raised the monkey to within a few
inches of the pulleys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> they lift their hands suddenly, thus slackening
the ropes and allowing the monkey to descend with its full weight on to
the clamp. The monkey is steadied by a third man, who also assists to
force it down at each descent. This man, likewise, from time to time,
with a pair of gas-tongs, turns the tube round in the ground, which
assists the process of driving, particularly when the point comes in
contact with stones.</p>

<p>Particular attention must be paid to the clamp, to see that it does
not move on the tube; the bolts must be tightened up at the first
appearance of any slipping.</p>

<p>When the clamp has been driven down to the ground, the monkey is raised
off it, the screws of the clamp are slackened, and the clamp is again
screwed to the tube, about 18 inches or 2 feet from the ground. After
this, the monkey is lowered on to it, and the pulleys are then raised
until they are again 6 or 7 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The driving is continued until but 5 or 6 inches of the well tube
remain above the ground, when the clamp, monkey, and pulleys are
removed, and an additional length of tube screwed on to that in the
ground. This is done by first screwing a collar on to the tube in the
ground, and then screwing the next length of tube into the collar, till
it buts against the lower tube; a little white-lead must be placed on
the threads of the collar before the ends of the tubes are screwed into
it.</p>

<p>The driving can thus be continued until the well has obtained the
desired depth. Soon after another length has been added, the upper
length should be turned round a little with the gas-tongs, to tighten
the joints, which have a tendency to become loose from the jarring of
the monkey. Care must be taken, after getting into a water-bearing
stratum, not to drive through it, owing to anxiety to get a large
supply. From time to time, and always before screwing on an additional
length of tube, the well should be sounded, by means of a small
lead attached to a line, to ascertain the depth of water, if any,
and character of the earth which has penetrated through the holes
perforated in the lower part of the well tube. As soon as it appears
that the well has been driven deep enough, the pump is screwed on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the top and the water drawn up. It usually happens that the water is at
first thick, and comes in but small quantities; but after pumping for
some little time, as the chamber round the bottom of the well becomes
enlarged, the quantity increases and the water becomes clearer.</p>

<p>When sinking in gravel or clay, the bottom of the well tube is liable
to become filled up by the material penetrating through the holes; and
before a supply of water can be obtained, this accumulation must be
removed by means of the cleaning pipes.</p>

<p>The cleaning pipes are of small diameter, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-inch externally, and the
several lengths are connected together in the same way as the well
tubes, by collars screwing on over the adjoining end of two pipes.</p>

<p>To clear the well, one cleaning pipe after another is lowered into the
well, until the lower end touches the accumulation; the pipes must
be held carefully, for if one were to drop into the well it would be
impossible to get it out without drawing the well. A pump is then
attached to the upper cleaning pipe by means of a reducing socket;
the lower end of the cleaning pipe is then raised and held about an
inch above the accumulation by means of the gas-tongs: water is next
poured down the well outside the cleaning pipe, and, being pumped up
through the cleaning pipe, brings up with it the upper portion of the
accumulation; the cleaning pipe is gradually lowered, and the pumping
continued until the whole of the stuff inside the well tube is removed.
The pump is then removed from the cleaning pipe, and the cleaning pipes
are withdrawn piece by piece; and finally the pump is screwed on to the
upper end of the tube well, <a href="#i_094">Fig. 96</a>, which is then in working order.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_094" id="i_094"></a>
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="" width="142" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 96.</p>
</div>

<p>The tube being very small, is in itself capable of containing only a
limited supply of water, which would be exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> by a few strokes of
the pump; the condition, therefore, upon which alone these tube wells
can be effective, is that there shall be a free flow of water from the
outside through the apertures into the lower end of the tube. When the
stratum in which the water is found is very porous, as in the case of
gravel and some sorts of chalk, the water flows freely; and a yield has
been obtained in such situations as great and rapid as the pump has
been able to lift, that is 600 gallons an hour. In some other soils,
such as sandy loam, the yield in itself may not be sufficiently rapid
to supply the pump; in such cases, the effect of constant pumping is to
draw up with the water from the bottom a good deal of clay and sand,
and so gradually to form a reservoir, as it were, around the foot of
the tube, in which water accumulates when the pump is not in action,
as is the case in a common well. In dense clays, however, of a close
and very tenacious character, the American tube well is not applicable,
as the small perforations become sealed, and water will not enter the
tube. When the stratum reached by driving is a quicksand, the quantity
of sand drawn up from the water will be so great, that a considerable
amount will have to be pumped before the water will come up clear; and
even in some positions, when the quicksand is of great extent, the
effect of the pumping may be to injure the foundations of adjoining
buildings on the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>The tube well cannot itself be driven through rock, although it might
be used for drawing water from a subjacent stratum through a hole bored
in the rock to receive it.</p>

<p>Subject to these conditions, these tube wells afford a ready and
economical means for drawing water to the surface from a depth not
exceeding 27 or 28 feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<span class="small">WELL BORING AT GREAT DEPTHS.</span></h2>

<p>The first well that was executed of great depth, and which gave rise
to the adoption of tools which directed public attention to the art of
well boring, was that for the city of Paris by Mulot, at the Abattoir
of Grenelle. This was commenced in the year 1832; and after more than
eight years&#8217; incessant labour, water rose, on the 26th of February,
1842, from the total depth of 1798 feet. Subsequent to this, many
wells have been sunk on the Continent, with the hope of attaining
the brine springs so often met with in the Rhine provinces, or the
springs destined for the supply of towns, and which are even deeper
than the well of Grenelle, reaching in some cases to the extraordinary
depth of 2800 feet; but all of them, like the Grenelle well, of
small diameter. In their construction, however, the German engineers
introduced some important modifications of the tools employed; and,
amongst other inventions, Euyenhausen imparted a sliding movement to
the striking part of the tool used for comminuting the rock, so as to
fall always through a certain distance; and thus, while he produced a
uniform action upon the rock at the bottom, he avoided the jar of the
tools. Kind also began to apply his system to the working of the large
excavations for the purpose of winning coal. Whilst the art was in
this state, and when he had already executed some very important works
in Germany, Belgium, the North of France, Creuzot, and Seraing, the
Municipal Council of Paris determined to entrust him with the execution
of a new well they were about to sink at Passy.</p>

<p>In sinking the well of Passy, the weight of the trepan for comminuting
the rock was about 1 ton 16 cwt., 1800 kilog.: the height through which
it fell was about 60 centim&egrave;tres; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> its diameter was 3 feet 3<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>
inches, 1 m&egrave;tre. The rods were of oak, about 8 inches on the side,
and the dimensions of the cutting tool were limited to 3 feet 3<sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>
inches because it worked the whole time in water; but generally the
class of borings Kind undertook were of such a description as justified
resorting to tools of great dimensions. When sinking the shafts for
winning coal, his operations required to be carried on with the full
diameters of 10 feet or 14 feet; and he then drove a boring of 3 feet 4
inches diameter in the first instance, and subsequently enlarged this
excavation. There can be no objection to executing Artesian borings
of this diameter, other than the probable exhaustion of the supply;
particularly as it is now known that the yield of water by these
methods is proportionate to the diameter of the column; though, strange
as it may appear, the first opposition to Kind&#8217;s plan of sinking the
well of Passy was founded upon the assumption that he would not meet
with a larger supply of water from the subcretaceous formations than
had been met with at Grenelle, where the diameter of the boring was
at the bottom not more than 8 inches. It is now, however, proved that
there is a direct gain in adopting the larger borings, not only as
regards the quantity of water to be derived from them, but also in
their execution, arising from the fact that the tools can be made
more secure against the effects of torsion or of concussion against
the sides of the excavation, which is the cause of the most serious
accidents met with in well sinking.</p>

<p>The trepan of M. Kind contains some peculiar details, which are shown
in <a href="#i_098">Figs. 97, 98</a>. The trepan is composed of two principal pieces, the
frame and the arms, both of wrought-iron, with the exception of the
teeth of the cutting part, which are of cast steel. The frame has at
the bottom a series of holes, slightly conical, into which the teeth
are inserted, and tightly wedged up, <a href="#i_098">Fig. 99</a>. These teeth are placed
with their cutting edges on the longitudinal axis of the frame that
receives them; and at the extremity of the frame there are formed two
heads, forged out of the same piece with the body of the tool, which
also carries two teeth, placed in the same direction as the others,
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> double their width, in order to render this part of the tool more
powerful. By increasing the dimensions of these end teeth, the diameter
of the boring can be augmented, so as to compensate for the diminution
of the clear space caused by the tubing, necessarily introduced for
security in traversing strata disposed to fall in, or for the purpose
of allowing the water from below to escape at an intermediate level.</p>

<p>Above the lower part of the frame of the trepan is a second piece
composed of two parts bolted together, and made to support the lower
portion of the frame. This part of the machinery also carries two teeth
at its extremities, which serve to guide the tool in its descent, and
to work off the asperities left by the lower portion of the trepan.
Above this, again, are the guides of the machinery, properly speaking,
consisting of two pieces of wrought-iron, arranged in the form of
a cross, with the ends turned up, so as to preserve the machinery
perfectly vertical in its movements, by pressing against the sides
of the boring already executed. These pieces are independent of the
blades of the trepan, and may be moved closer to it or farther away
from it, as may be desired. The stem and the arms are terminated by a
single piece of wrought-iron, which is joined to the frame with a kind
of saddle-joint, and is kept in its place by means of keys and wedges.
The whole of the trepan is finally jointed to the great rods that
communicate the motion from the surface, by means of a screw-coupling,
formed below the part of the tool which bears the joint; this
arrangement permits the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> free fall of the cutting part, and unites the
top of the arms and frame, and the rod, <a href="#i_099">Fig. 100</a>. It has been proposed
to substitute for this screw-coupling a keyed joint, in order to avoid
the inconvenience frequently found to attend the rusting of the screw,
which often interposes great difficulties in cases where it becomes
necessary to withdraw the trepan.</p>

<p>The sliding joint is the part of Euyenhausen&#8217;s invention most
unhesitatingly adopted by Kind, and it is one of the peculiarities of
his system as contrasted with the processes formerly in use. So long as
his operations were confined to the small dimensions usually adopted
for Artesian borings, he contented himself with making a description of
joint with a free fall; a simple movement of disengagement regulating
the height fixed by the machinery itself, like the fall of the monkey
in a pile-driving machine; but it was found that this system did not
answer when applied to large borings, and it also presented certain
dangers. Kind then, for the larger class of borings, availed himself
of sliding guides, so contrived as to be equally thrown out of gear
when the machinery had come to the end of the stroke, and maintained
in their respective positions by being made in two pieces, of which
the inner one worked upon slides, moving freely in the piece that
communicated the motion to the striking part of the machinery. The two
parts of the tool were connected with pins, and with a sliding joint,
which, in the Passy well, was thrown out of gear by the reaction of
the column of water above the tool unloosing the click that upheld
the lower part of the trepan, <a href="#i_100">Figs. 101 to 103</a>. The changes thus made
in the usual way of releasing the tool, and in guiding it in its fall
were, however, matters of detail; they involved no new principle in
the manner of well boring: and the modern authorities upon the subject
consider that there was something deficient in Kind&#8217;s system of making
the column of water act upon a disc by which the click was set in
motion. This system, in fact, required the presence of a column of
water not always to be commanded, especially when the borings had to be
executed in the carboniferous strata.</p>

<p>The rods used for the suspension of the trepan, and for the
transmission of the blows to it, were of oak; and this alone would
constitute one of the most characteristic differences between the
system of tools introduced by Kind and those made by the majority of
well-borers, but which, like the disengagement of the tool intended
to comminute the rock, depended for its success upon the boring
being filled with water. The resistance that the wood offers, by its
elasticity, to the effects of any sudden jar, is also to be taken
into account in the comparison of the latter with iron, for the iron
is liable to change its form under the influence of this cause. The
resistance to an effort of torsion need not, however, be much dwelt
on, for the turn given to the trepan is always made when the tool
is lifted up from its bed. For the purpose of making the rods, Kind
recommended that straight-grown trees, of the requisite diameter,
should be selected, rather than they should be made of cut-timber, as
there is less danger of the wood warping, and the character of the wood
is more homogeneous. He generally used these trees in lengths of about
50 feet, and he connected them at the ends with wrought-iron joints,
fitting one into the other, <a href="#i_100">Fig. 104</a>. The ironwork of the joints is
made with a shoulder underneath the screw-coupling, to allow the rods
to be suspended by the ordinary crow&#8217;s foot during the operation of
raising or lowering them. In the works executed at Passy there was a
kind of frame erected over the centre of the boring, of sufficient
height to allow of the rods being withdrawn in two lengths at a time,
thus producing a considerable economy of time and labour.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_101" id="i_101"></a>

</div>

<p>Nearly all the processes yet introduced for removing the products of
the excavation must be considered to be, more or less,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
defective, because all are established on the supposition that the
comminuting tool must be withdrawn, in order that the shell, or other
tool intended to remove the products of the working of the comminutor,
may be inserted. This remark applies to Kind&#8217;s operations at Passy
and elsewhere, as he removed the rock detached from the bottom of the
excavation by a shell, <a href="#i_101">Figs. 105, 106</a>, which was a modification of the
tool he invariably employs for this purpose. It consisted of a cylinder
of wrought-iron, suspended from the rods by a frame, and fastened to
it, a little below the centre of gravity, so that the operation of
upsetting it, when loaded, could be easily performed. This cylinder
was lowered to the level of the last workings of the trepan, and the
materials already detached by that instrument were forced into the
tool, by the gradual movement of the latter in a vertical direction.
Some other implements, employed by Kind for the purpose of removing
the products of the excavation in the shafts for the coal-mines of
the North of France, were ingenious, and well adapted to the large
dimensions of the shafts; but they were all, in some degree, exposed to
the danger of becoming fixed, if used in the small borings of Artesian
wells, by the minute particles of rocks falling down between their
sides and the excavation from above. Their use was therefore abandoned,
and the well of Passy was cleared out with the shell, the bottom of
which was made to open upwards, with a hinged flap, which admitted
the finer materials detached by the trepan. There were also several
tools for the purpose of withdrawing the broken parts of the machinery
from the excavation, or whatever substances might fall in from above;
and all were marked by a great degree of simplicity, but they did not
differ enough from those generally used for the same purpose to merit
further remarks. In fact, the accidents intended to be guarded against
or remedied are so precisely alike in all cases, that there can be
little variety in the manufacture of these instruments. But there is no
doubt that Kind deprived himself of a valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> appliance in not using
the ball-clack, <i>la soupape &agrave; boulet</i>, that other well-borers employ,
<a href="#i_102a">Fig. 107</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_102a" id="i_102a"></a>
<img src="images/i_102a.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="300" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 107.</p>
</div>

<p>At Passy great strength was given to the head of the striking tool, and
to the part of the machinery applied to turn the trepan, because the
great weight of the latter superinduced the danger of its breaking off
under the influence of the shock, and because the solidity of this part
of the machinery necessarily regulated the whole working of the tool.
The head of the boring arrangement was connected with the balance-beam
of the steam-engine by a straight link-chain, with a screw-coupling,
admitting of being lengthened as the trepan descended, <a href="#i_102b">Figs. 108, 109</a>.
The balance-beam, in order to increase its elastic force in the upward
stroke, is in Kind&#8217;s works made of wood, in two pieces; the upper one
being of fir and the lower one of beech. The whole of the machinery
is put in motion by steam, which is admitted to the upper part of
the cylinder, and presses it down, and thus raises the tool at the
other end of the beam to that part in connection with the cylinder.
The counterpoise to the weight of the tools is also placed upon the
cylinder-end of the beam. The cylinder receives the steam through ports
that are opened and closed by hand, like those of a steam-hammer;
so that the number of the strokes of the piston may be increased or
diminished, and the length of the strokes may be increased, as occasion
may require.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_102b" id="i_102b"></a>
<img src="images/i_102b.jpg" alt="" width="182" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 108, 109.</p>
</div>

<p>The balance-beam is continued beyond the point where the piston is
connected with it, and it goes to meet the blocks placed to check the
force of the blow given by the descent of the tool. The guides of the
piston-head are attached to the part of the machinery that acts in this
manner; but at Passy, Kind made the balance-beam work upon two free
plummer-blocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> or blocks having no permanent cover, that they might
be more easily moved whenever it was necessary to displace the beam,
for the purpose of taking up or letting down the rods, or for changing
the tools; for the balance-beam was always immediately over the centre
of the tools, and it therefore had to be displaced every time that the
latter were required to be changed. This was effected by allowing the
beam to slide horizontally, so as to leave the mouth of the pit open.
The counter-check, above mentioned, likewise prevented the piston
from striking the cylinder cover with too great a force, when it was
brought back by the weight of the tools to its original position. The
operation of raising and lowering the rods, or of changing the tools,
was performed at Passy by a separate steam-engine, and the shell was
discharged into a special truck, moving upon a railway expressly laid
for this purpose in the great tower erected over the excavation. All
these arrangements were in fact made with the extreme attention to
the details of the various parts of the work which characterizes the
proceedings of foreign engineers, and conduces so much to their success.</p>

<p>The beating, or comminution of the rock, was usually effected at Passy
at the rate of from fifteen strokes to twenty strokes a minute. The
rate of descent, of course, differed in a marked manner, according to
the nature of the rock operated upon; but, generally speaking, the
trepan was worked for the space of about eight hours at a time, after
which it was withdrawn, and the shell let down in order to remove the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>. The average number of men employed in the gang, besides the
foreman, or the superintendent of the well, was about fourteen: they
consisted of a smith and hammerman, whose duty it was to keep the
tools in order; and two shifts of men entrusted with the excavation,
namely, an engine-driver and stoker, a chief workman, or sub-foreman,
and three assistants. The total time employed in sinking the shafts
executed upon this system in the North of France, where it has been
applied without meeting with the accidents encountered in the Passy
well, was found to be susceptible of being divided in the following
manner: from 25 per cent. to 56 per cent. was employed in man&oelig;uvring
the trepan;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> from 11 per cent. to 14<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> per cent. in raising and
lowering the tools; from 19 per cent. to 21 per cent. in removing the
materials detached from the rocks, and cleaning out the bottom of the
excavation; and from 8 per cent. to 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> per cent. was lost, owing to
the stoppage of the engines, or to the accidents from broken tools, or
to other causes always attending these operations. In the well of Passy
there was, of course, a considerable difference in the proportions of
the time employed in the various details of the work; and the long
period occupied in obviating the effects of the slips which took place
in the clays, both in the basement beds of the Paris basin and in
the subcretaceous strata, would render any comparison derived from
that well of little value; but it would appear that, until the great
accident occurred, the various operations went on precisely as Kind had
calculated upon.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Kind-Chaudron System.</span></h3>

</div>

<p>In the year 1872 Emerson Bainbridge, C.E., drew attention to the
Kind-Chaudron system of sinking mine shafts through water-bearing
strata, without the use of pumping machinery, in a paper read before
the Institute of Civil Engineers. As the operation is almost identical
with that which would have to be carried through in the case of a
well sunk through an upper series of water-bearing strata, of minor
importance or of impure quality, past rock and into the lower water
strata, as for instance through tertiaries and chalk into the lower
greensand, the following extract from Bainbridge&#8217;s paper may be read
with interest.</p>

<p>In the first place, it may be desirable to describe briefly the system
of sinking hitherto pursued in passing through strata yielding large
quantities of water. The most important sinkings of this character
have been carried out in the county of Durham, to the east of the
point at which the Permian overlie the carboniferous rocks. In this
district there is a thin bed of sand between the Permian rock and the
coal measures. Towards this bed the feeders of water are generally
found to increase, and in the sand there is usually a large reservoir
of water. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> mode of sinking will be understood by reference to <a href="#i_105tb">Fig. 110</a>.
Whilst sinking in hard rock, it has ordinarily been the custom
to place iron curbs, or cribs, wherever a bed of stone appeared to
form a natural barrier between two distinct feeders of water. Thus
it has frequently happened that important feeders have been tubbed
back, rendering much less pumping power necessary than would have been
required had all the feeders been allowed to accumulate in the shaft.
As will be seen by <a href="#i_105tb">Fig. 110</a>, the number of wedging cribs employed is
no less than thirteen in 250 feet. The cribs forming the foundation of
each set of tubbing are generally much more massive and costly than the
segments of tubbing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_106" id="i_106"></a>
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="275" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 111, 112.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_107" id="i_107"></a>
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 113.</p>
</div>

<p>The process of fixing the crib is as follows;&mdash;The diameter of the
shaft is made about 30 inches larger than that of the inside of the
tubbing. When a bed of rock, which may be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> sufficiently
hard and close to separate the feeders above and below it, is reached,
the shaft is contracted to the diameter of the tubbing, and a smooth
horizontal face is made on which to place the wedging crib. The wedging
crib, which usually consists of segments about 4 feet long by 6 inches
high by 14 inches wide, is then placed on the bed. To give the crib a
firm and secure position, it is tightly wedged with wood, both behind
and between the joints; the tubbing is then built upon it to the next
wedging crib, which rests upon a bell-shaped section of rock. When the
tubbing nearly reaches this crib, the rock is removed piece by piece,
and the top ring of tubbing is placed close up against the crib. It
will thus be seen that the fixing of each crib is a costly process,
often causing considerable delay.</p>

<p>In some cases, where it has been difficult to find suitable foundations
for intermediate wedging cribs, the whole of the water-bearing
rocks have been sunk through without attempting to stop the feeders
separately, and no tubbing has been placed in the shaft till the
wedging crib could be fixed below the lowest feeder. This process is
more expeditious where there are small quantities of water; but where
the water is excessive greater delay is caused by contending with it
than from putting in numerous sets of tubbing to stop the feeders
separately. The tubbing used in England has almost invariably been of
cast-iron; on the Continent, till recently, tubbing of wood has chiefly
been used. Illustrations of both descriptions are shown by <a href="#i_106">Figs. 111
and 112</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Figs. <a href="#i_107">113</a>, <a href="#i_108">114</a>, show, in elevation, the plant and the arrangements
generally in use at extensive sinkings. Where the water is in large
quantities it is usually pumped by an engine erected for the purpose,
assisted by the engine or engines intended to be employed to raise the
coal. A small capstan engine is used for passing the men and material
up and down the pit during the sinking, such engine being provided
also with a drum on slow motion, which is used for heavy weights. The
continual pumping, the placing of cribs, and the fixing of the tubbing
are proceeded with till the lowest feeder is reached, when a hard bed
is sought for on which to fix the lowest wedging crib. In all cases the
water has to be pumped out before the wedging crib, which forms the
foundation of each set of tubbing, can be placed.</p>

<p>From this description it will be understood that the sinkers, who
number from ten to twelve at one time, working four hours at a shift in
a pit, say, 14 feet in diameter, are compelled to work in water until
all the tubbing is fixed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> causes a serious obstacle to blasting,
and in other ways delays the progress of the work.</p>

<p>The tubbing used for damming back the water is generally in segments
from 1 foot to 3 feet high, and about 4 feet in length, the thickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
varying from half an inch to 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches. It is kept in position by
packing with wood behind the joints; and is made water-tight by placing
between the segments pieces of wood sheeting about half an inch thick,
which are wedged when all the tubbing is fixed, usually twice with
wood, and sometimes once with iron wedges.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_109c" id="i_109c"></a>
<img src="images/i_109c.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="462" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 117.</p>
</div>

<p>To equalize the pressure of water and gas behind the different sets of
tubbing, pass pipes, Figs. <a href="#i_108">115</a> and <a href="#i_109a">116</a>, are sometimes used. Another
expedient to effect this is to have a valve, working upwards, placed in
the wedging crib, <a href="#i_109c">Fig. 117</a>. A ball is also sometimes used, <a href="#i_109b">Fig. 118</a>.</p>

<p>The various modes of piercing beds of
quicksand are;&mdash;By hanging tubbing to that already fixed, and adding
fresh rings as the sand is removed. This is only practicable when the
quantity of sand is inconsiderable. By heavily weighting a cylinder of
iron of the same size as the shaft, and thus forcing it down through
the sand. By keeping back the sand by the use of piles&mdash;a resource that
can only be recommended when the bed of sand is not of great thickness.
When the water is excessive, by using pneumatic agency. As these
operations are apart from our immediate subject we need not further
discuss them.</p>

<p>M. Chaudron&#8217;s system, which is a modification of Kind&#8217;s, is divisible
into the following distinct processes, which consist of;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>The erection of the necessary machinery on the surface, and the opening
of the mine.</p>

<p>The boring of the pits to the lowest part of the water-bearing strata.</p>

<p>The placing of the tubbing.</p>

<p>The introduction of cement behind the tubbing to complete its solidity.</p>

<p>The extraction of the water from the pits, and the placing of the
wedging cribs, or &#8220;faux cuvelage,&#8221; below the moss box.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#i_110">119</a> to <a href="#i_112">121</a> show in elevations and in plan the plant usually
employed on the surface. O is a small capstan engine, having a cylinder
20 inches in diameter and a stroke of 32 inches, working on the third
motion. Attached to this engine, and working in the small pit C, is a
counterbalance weight. This engine is used for raising and lowering
boring tools, and for lifting the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> resulting from the boring.
As far as the platform, which is about 10 feet from the surface, the
pit has a diameter of 19 feet, or 4 feet more than the diameter of the
pit below. A at level of about 38 feet above this platform there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a tramway on which small trucks run, carrying the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> cylinder
on one side, and the boring tools on the other. At a level of 48 feet
above the platform are placed supports for the wooden spears to which
the boring tools are attached. The machinery for boring is worked by
a cylinder, which has a diameter of 39<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> inches, and a full stroke
of 39<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> inches, the usual stroke varying from 2 feet to 3 feet. A
massive beam of wood transmits motion from this cylinder to the boring
apparatus, the connection between the beam and the piston-rod and the
beam and the boring tools being made by a chain. The engine-man sits
close to the engine, and applies the steam above the piston only. The
down stroke of the boring tools is caused by the sudden opening of
the exhaust, and a frame then prevents the shock of the boring rods
from being too severe. The engines work at speeds varying from 12 to
18 strokes a minute, according to the character of the strata passed
through.</p>

<p>After the working platform is fixed, the first boring tool applied
is the small trepan, <a href="#i_113">Figs. 122 to 125</a>. This tool is attached to the
wooden beam by the same arrangement shown by <a href="#i_102b">Fig. 109</a>. The boring
tools can be lowered at pleasure by means of an adjusting screw. Next
in order comes the handle for boring. This is worked by four men on
the platform, and is turned by the aid of a swivel. Attached to the
handle-piece are wooden rods, made from Riga pitch pine. These rods
are 59 feet in length and 7<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches square. A swivelled ring, <a href="#i_113">Figs.
126, 127</a>, is attached to the rope when raising and lowering the boring
rods. The small trepan cuts a hole 4 feet 8<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches in diameter, and
has fourteen teeth, fitted in cylindrical holes and secured by pins
entering through circular slots. The teeth are steeled. At a distance
of 4 feet 4 inches above the main teeth of the trepan there is an arm,
with a tooth at each end. This piece answers the purpose of a guide,
and at the same time removes irregularities from the sides of the hole.
At a distance of 13 feet 6 inches above the main teeth are the actual
guides, consisting of two strong arms of iron fixed on the tool, and
placed at right-angles to each other. The hole made by the small trepan
is not kept at any fixed distance in advance of the full-sized pit,
but the distance generally varies from 10 to 30 yards. With the small
trepan, which weighs 8 tons, the progress varies from 6 to 10 feet a
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>The large trepan, Figs. <a href="#i_114tb">128</a> to <a href="#i_115a">130</a>, weighs 16<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tons, is forged in
one solid piece, and has twenty-eight teeth. A projection of iron forms
the centre of this trepan, and fits loosely into the hole made by the
small trepan, acting as a guide for the tool. At a distance of 7 feet 6
inches above the teeth, a guide is sometimes fixed on the frame, but is
not furnished with teeth. At a distance of 13 feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
3 inches from the teeth are two other guides at right-angles to each
other. These guides are let down the pit with the boring tool, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>hinged part of the guides being raised whilst passing through the
beams at the top of the pit, which are only 6 feet 7 inches apart.
When the tool is ready to work, the two arms are let down against the
side of the pit, and are hung in the shaft by ropes, thus acting as
a guide for the trepan, which moves through them. To provide against
a shock to the spears when the trepan strikes the rock on the down
stroke, at the upper part of the frame a slot motion is arranged, the
play of which amounts to about half an inch. The teeth of the large
trepan are not horizontal, but are deeper towards the inside of the
pit, the face of the inside tooth being 3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches lower than the
outside. The object of this is to cause the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> to drop at once
into the small hole, by the face of the rock at the bottom of the
pit being somewhat inclined. The teeth used, <a href="#i_115b">Figs. 131 to 134</a>, are
the same both for the large and the small trepan, and weigh about 72
lb. each. As a rule, only one set of teeth is kept in use, this set
working for twelve hours, the alternate twelve hours being employed
in raising the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. This time is divided in about the following
proportions;&mdash;Boring, twelve hours; drawing the rods, one hour to
five hours, according to depth; raising the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, two hours; and
lowering the rods one hour to five hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> The maximum speed of the
larger trepan may be taken at about 3 feet a day. The ordinary distance
sunk is not more than 2 feet a day, and in flint and other hard rocks
the boring has proceeded as slowly as 3 inches a day.</p>

<p>The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> in the small bore-hole contains pieces of a maximum size
of about 8 cubic inches. In the large boring, pieces of rock measuring
32 cubic inches have been found. As a rule, however, the material
is beaten very fine, having much the appearance of mud or sand. In
both the large and the small borings the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> is raised by a
shell, similar to <a href="#i_101">Figs. 105, 106</a>, and in this system consisting of a
wrought-iron cylinder, 3 feet 3 inches in diameter by 6 feet 9 inches
long, and containing two flap-valves at the bottom, through which the
excavated material enters. This apparatus is passed down the shaft by
the bore-rods, and it is moved up and down through a distance varying
from 6 to 8 inches, for about a quarter of an hour, and is then drawn
up and emptied. In some cases where the rock is hard, three sizes of
trepan are used consecutively, the sizes being 5 feet, 8 feet, and 13
feet.</p>

<p>The several other tools and appliances used during the boring
operations are shown, <a href="#i_116a">Figs. 135 to 140</a>, including the key, <a href="#i_116a">Figs. 139,
140</a>, used at the surface to disconnect the rods, the hook on which each
rod is hung after being raised to the high platform and there detached,
the bar upon which the hooks are moved,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

and the fork for suspending the rods or tools from the rollers when it
is desired to move the rods or tools from above the shaft.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#i_116b">141</a> to <a href="#i_117">146</a> are of the connections to the trepan and spears or
rods.</p>

<p>Should broken tools fall into the shaft, several varieties of apparatus
are used for their recovery. In case of broken rods of any kind having
a protuberance that can be clutched, a hook or crow, <a href="#i_116a">Figs. 137, 138</a>,
of an epicycloidal form, enables the object to be taken hold of very
readily. Where the broken part has no shoulder which can be held, but
is simply a bar, the apparatus shown by <a href="#i_118">Figs. 147, 148</a>, is employed.
This is composed of two parts. The rods, the bottom of which have teeth
inside, are prevented from diverging by the cone and slide on the main
rods. When passed over a rod or pipe, they clutch it by means of the
teeth, and draw it up. Chaudron has, by this tool, raised a column
of pipes 295 feet in length and 8 inches in diameter. An instrument,
called a &#8220;grapin,&#8221; <a href="#i_118">Figs. 149, 150</a>, is used for raising broken teeth or
other small objects which may have fallen into the bottom of the shaft.
This tool also has one part sliding in the other, and is lowered with
the claws closed. The parts are moved by two ropes worked from the
surface. By weighting the cross-bar, which is attached to the moving
parts, the pressure desired can be exerted on the claws. The weight
is then lifted, the claws are opened, and are made to close upon the
substance to be raised. This instrument is now seldom required.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_118" id="i_118"></a>
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="452" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 147-150.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>In boring shafts in the manner described, without being able to prove
in the usual way the perpendicularity of the shaft, it might be feared
that the system would be open to objection on this account. It appears,
however, that in all cases where Chaudron has sunk shafts by this
system he has succeeded in making them perfectly vertical. This is
ensured by the natural effect of the treble guide, which the chisels
and the two sets of arms attached to the boring tools afford, and by
the fact that if the least divergence from a plumb-line is made by the
boring tool, the friction of the tool upon one side of the shaft is so
great as to cause the borers to be unable to turn the instrument.</p>

<p>Boring alternately with the large and the small instrument, the shaft
is at length sunk to the point at which the lowest feeder of water
is encountered. In a new district this has to be taken, to some
extent, at hazard; but where pits have been sunk previously, it is not
difficult to tell, by observing the strata, almost the exact point at
which the bottom of the tubbing may be safely fixed. This point being
ascertained, the third process is arrived at.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_119" id="i_119"></a>
<img src="images/i_119.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 151.</p>
</div>

<p>As the object of placing tubbing in a shaft is effectually to shut off
the feeders, which for water supply may have some bad qualities, and to
secure a water-tight joint at the base, it is important that the bed
on which the moss box has to rest should be quite level and smooth.
This is attained by the use of a tool, termed a &#8220;scraper,&#8221; attached to
the bore-rods, the blades being made to move round the face of the bed
intended for the moss box. The tubbing employed is cast in complete
cylinders. At Maurage each ring has an internal diameter of 12 feet and
is 4 feet 9 inches high.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> Each ring has an inside flange at the top and
bottom, and also a rib in the middle, the top and bottom of the ring
being turned and faced. The rings of tubbing are attached to each other
by twenty-eight bolts 1&#183;1 inch in diameter, passed through holes bored
in the flanges. The tubbing is suspended in the pit by means of six
rods, which are let down by capstans placed at a distance of 30 feet
above the top of the pit. These machines work upon long screws. When a
new ring of tubbing is added, the rods are detached at a lower level,
and are hung upon chains, thus leaving an open space for passing it
forward. Before each ring is put into the pit it is tested by hydraulic
apparatus, <a href="#i_119">Fig. 151</a>. The tubbing is usually proved to one-half more
pressure than it is expected to be subjected to. At Maurage, where a
length of 550 feet of tubbing has to be put in, the chief particulars
respecting it are;&mdash;</p>

<p>The joints between the rings of tubbing are made with sheet lead
one-eighth of an inch thick, coated with red-lead. The lead is allowed
to obtrude from the joint one-third of an inch, and is wedged up by
a tool which has a face one-twelfth of an inch thick. The mode of
suspending the tubbing to the rods will be understood by referring
to <a href="#i_121">Figs. 152 to 154</a>. The rods are attached to a ring by the bolts
connecting one ring of tubbing with another. The bottom ring of tubbing
and the ring carrying the moss box have their top flange turned
inwards, but their bottom flange outwards. A strong web of iron,
forming the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> of a tube 16<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches in diameter, is attached
to the tubbing. The object of this tube is to cause the water in the
shaft to ease the suspension rods, by bearing part of the weight of the
tubbing. Cocks to admit water are placed at intervals up the tube, by
which means the weight upon the rods can be easily regulated, so that
not more than one-tenth to one-twentieth of the weight of the tubbing
is suspended by the rods at one time. The ring holding the moss box is
hung from the bottom joint in the tubbing by sliding rods.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_121" id="i_121"></a>
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" alt="" width="407" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 152-154.</p>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of the moss box which forms the base of the tubbing is
one of the most important points requiring attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> in this system of
sinking. Ordinary peat moss is used. It is enclosed in a net, which,
with the aid of springs, keeps it in its place during the descent of
the tubbing. When the moss box, which hangs on short rods fixed to
the tubbing, reaches the face of rock, it is dropped gently upon it,
and the whole weight of the tubbing is allowed to rest upon the bed.
This compresses the moss, the capacity of the chamber holding it is
diminished, and the moss is forced against the sides of the shaft,
thus forming a water-tight joint, past which no water can escape. This
completes the third process.</p>

<p>It may be noted that up to this point the following important
differences between this and the ordinary system of placing tubbing are
to be observed;&mdash;The tubbing, on reaching its bed, bears the aggregate
pressure of all the feeders of water which have been met with in the
shaft. The tubbing, having been passed down the shaft in the manner
described, no wedging behind, or other modes of consolidating it in
the shaft, have been carried out. The connection between each ring of
tubbing is so carefully made, that the repeated wedging of the joints,
as in the ordinary system, is rendered unnecessary. The pit is still
full of water up to the ordinary level.</p>

<p>Under these conditions the next process is;&mdash;The introduction of cement
behind the tubbing to complete its solidity.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_123" id="i_123"></a>
<img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 155, 156.</p>
</div>

<p>Before the water is removed, the annular space between the tubbing and
the sides of the shaft is filled with hydraulic cement, to render the
tubbing impermeable, by a process of consolidation, less liable to the
effect of any pressure of water or gas which may be exerted towards the
centre of the shaft. The cement is inserted behind the tubbing by close
ladles, <a href="#i_123">Figs. 155, 156</a>, capable of holding 44 gallons, and consisting
of two iron plates, one-eighth of an inch thick, fixed on two wooden
uprights 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inches square. This apparatus is curved to suit the
mean circumference of the space to be concreted. A piston is placed
at the top of the ladle, and to this piston is attached a rod, which
can be moved from the surface; a door is also attached to the piston.
The ladle containing the concrete is passed down behind the tubbing by
means of a windlass at the surface, and when it reaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> lowest
point, the piston is pushed down and the cement allowed to escape from
the chamber. The weight of the cement and the ladle is sufficient with
a little ballast to enable it to descend easily.</p>

<p>A number of experiments have been made to discover a cement which will
not harden too quickly, and which, when hardened, will form a perfectly
compact and solid mass. A composition having the following proportions
has been found the best;&mdash;Hydraulic lime, from the lias near Metz,
slaked by sprinkling, 1 part; picked sand, from the Vosges sandstone,
1 part; trass, from Andernacht on the Rhine, 1 part; cement from Ropp
(Haute Saone), <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> part.</p>

<p>Six men are employed in putting in the cement;&mdash;two at the windlass
for letting down the ladle, two for working the rods attached to the
piston, and two on the working platform. The rods referred to have been
found such an inconvenience, that lately a rope on another windlass has
been used, and an appliance arranged for dropping the piston by moving
the rope.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_124" id="i_124"></a>
<img src="images/i_124.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="404" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 157.</p>
</div>

<p>When a sufficient time has elapsed for the cement to harden, the
water within the tubbing, now effectually separated from the feeders,
is drawn out by a bucket worked by the crab engine,&mdash;an operation
which occupies from one to three weeks, according to circumstances.
When concluded, the joint between the moss box and the rock bed can
be examined. In some cases this joint is considered sufficient; but
it is generally thought desirable to form a base to the tubbing by
building a few feet of brickwork in cement on a ring or crib of wood,
as in <a href="#i_124">Fig. 157</a>. Another wooden crib is then placed on the top of this
brickwork, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> above this, two cast-iron segmental wedging cribs with
a broad bed also wedged perfectly tight. On the base so prepared, four
or more rings of tubbing in segments are fixed, the top ring coming
close against the bottom of the moss box. This being done the work is
completed, and the sinking of the shaft is continued in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>The application of the boring trepan is not to be recommended in the
sinking of the dry part of the shaft. The use of the tool would cause
the sinking to extend over a longer period, since the breaking of the
rock passed through into such minute particles would lead to loss of
time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dru&#8217;s System.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_125" id="i_125"></a>
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 158.</p>
</div>

<p>The system applied by Dru is worthy of attention, not so much on
account of the novelty of the invention, or of any new principle
involved in it, as on account of the contrivances it contains for the
application of the tool, &#8220;<i>&agrave; chute libre</i>,&#8221; or the free-falling tool,
to Artesian wells of large diameters. It has been already explained
that under Kind&#8217;s arrangements the trepan was thrown out of gear by
the reaction of the water which was allowed to find its way into
the column of the excavation; but that it is not always possible to
command the supply of the quantity necessary for that purpose; and
even when possible, the clutch Kind adopted was so shaped as to be
subject to much and rapid wear. Dru, with a view to obviate both these
inconveniences, made his first trepan similar to that shown in <a href="#i_100">Fig.
101</a>, in which it will be seen that the tool was gradually raised until
it came in contact with the fixed part of the upper machinery, when
it was thrown out of gear. The bearings of the clutch were parallel
to the horizontal line, and were found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> in practice to be more evenly
worn, so that this instrument could be worked sometimes from eight days
to fourteen days without intermission; whereas, on Kind&#8217;s system, the
trepan was frequently withdrawn after two days&#8217; or three days&#8217; service.</p>

<p>We take the following complete account of the system from a paper read
by M. Dru at the Conservatoire des Arts et M&eacute;tiers, Paris, 6th June,
1867.</p>

<p>It will be seen from Figs. <a href="#i_125">158</a>, <a href="#i_126">159</a>, that the boring rod A is suspended
from the outer end of the working beam B, which is made of timber
hooped with iron, working upon a middle bearing, and is connected at
the inner end to the vertical steam cylinder C, of 10 inches diameter
and 39 inches stroke. The stroke of the boring rod is reduced to
22 inches, by the inner end of the beam being made longer than the
outer end, serving as a partial counterbalance for the weight of the
boring rod. The steam cylinder is shown enlarged in <a href="#i_126">Fig. 160</a>, and is
single-acting, being used only to lift the boring rod at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> stroke,
and the rod is lowered again by releasing the steam from the top side
of the piston; the stroke is limited by timber stops both below and
above the end of the working beam B.</p>

<p>The boring tool is the part of most importance in the apparatus, and
the one that has involved most difficulty in maturing its construction.
The points to be aimed at in this are,&mdash;simplicity of construction and
repairs; the greatest force of blow possible for each unit of striking
surface; and freedom from liability to get turned aside and choked.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_126" id="i_126"></a>
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" width="371" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 159-162.</p>
</div>

<p>The tool used in small borings is a single chisel, as shown in <a href="#i_126">Figs.
161, 162</a>; but for the large borings it is found best to divide the
tool-face into separate chisels, each of convenient size and weight for
forging. All the chisels, however, are kept in a straight line, whereby
the extent of striking surface is reduced; and the tool is rendered
less liable to be turned aside by meeting a hard portion of flint on a
single point of the striking edge, which would diminish the effect of
the blow.</p>

</div>

<p>The tool is shown in Figs. <a href="#i_127a">163</a> to <a href="#i_127c">169</a>, and is composed of a
wrought-iron body D, connected by a screwed end E to the boring rod,
and carrying the chisels F F, fixed in separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> sockets and secured
by nuts above; two or four chisels are used, or sometimes even a
greater number, according to the size of the hole to be bored. This
construction allows of any broken chisel being easily replaced; and
also, by changing the breadth of the two outer chisels, the diameter of
the hole bored can be regulated exactly as may be desired. When four
chisels are used, the two centre ones are made a little longer than the
others, as shown in <a href="#i_127a">Fig. 167</a>, to form a leading hole as a guide to the
boring rod. A cross-bar G, of the same width as the tool, guides it in
the hole in the direction at right-angles to the tool; and in the case
of the larger and longer tools a second cross-bar higher up, at right-angles
to the first and parallel to the striking edge of the tool, is
also added.</p>

<p>If the whole length of the boring rod were allowed to fall suddenly to
the bottom of a large bore-hole at each stroke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
frequent breakages would occur; it is therefore found requisite to
arrange for the tool to be detached from the boring rod at a fixed
point in each stroke, and this has led to the general adoption of
<i>free-falling tools</i>. M. Dru&#8217;s plan of self-acting free-falling tool,
liberated by reaction, is shown in side and front view in <a href="#i_128">Figs. 170 to
173</a>. The hook H, attached to the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> of the boring tool D, slides
vertically in the box K, which is screwed to the lower extremity of
the boring rod; and the hook engages with the catch J, centred in
the sides of the box K, whereby the tool is lifted as the boring rod
rises. The tail of the catch J bears against an inclined plane L, at
the top of the box K; and the two holes carrying the centre-pin I of
the catch, are made oval in the vertical direction, so as to allow a
slight vertical movement of the catch. When the boring rod reaches the
top of the stroke, it is stopped suddenly by the tail end of the beam
B, <a href="#i_126">Fig. 159</a>, striking upon the wood buffer-block E; and the shock thus
occasioned causes a slight jump of the catch J in the box K; the tail
of the catch is thereby thrown outwards by the incline L, as shown in
<a href="#i_128">Fig. 172</a>, liberating the hook H, and the tool then falls freely to the
bottom of the bore-hole, as shown in <a href="#i_128">Fig. 173</a>. When the boring rod
descends again after the tool, the catch J again engages with the hook
H, enabling the tool to be raised for the next blow, as in <a href="#i_128">Fig. 171</a>.</p>

<p>Another construction of self-acting free-falling tool, liberated by a
separate disengaging rod, is shown in side and front view in <a href="#i_130">Figs. 174
to 178</a>. This tool consists of four principal pieces, the hook H, the
catch J, the pawl I, and the disengaging rod M. The hook H, carrying
the boring tool D, slides between the two vertical sides of the box
K, which is screwed to the bottom of the boring rod; and the catch J
works in the same space upon a centre-pin fixed in the box, so that the
tool is carried by the rod, when hooked on the catch, as shown in <a href="#i_130">Fig.
175</a>. At the same time the pawl I, at the back of the catch J, secures
it from getting unhooked from the tool; but this pawl is centred in
a separate sliding hoop N, forming the top of the disengaging rod M,
which slides freely up and down within a fixed distance upon the box
K; and in its lowest position the hoop N rests upon the upper of the
two guides P P, <a href="#i_130">Fig. 174</a>, through which the disengaging rod M slides
outside the box K. In lowering the boring rod, the disengaging rod
M reaches the bottom of the bore-hole first, as shown in <a href="#i_130">Figs. 174,
175</a>, and being then stopped it prevents the pawl I from descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
any lower; and the inclined back of the catch J sliding down past the
pawl, the latter forces the catch out of the hook H, as shown in <a href="#i_130">Fig.
176</a>, thus allowing the tool D to fall freely and strike its blow. The
height of fall of the tool is always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> same, being determined only
by the length of the disengaging rod M.</p>

<p>The blow having been struck, and the boring rod continuing to be
lowered to the bottom of the hole, the catch J falls back into its
original position, and engages again with the hook H, as shown in <a href="#i_130">Fig.
177</a>, ready for lifting the tool in the next stroke. As the boring rod
rises, the tail of the catch J trips up the pawl I in passing, as shown
in <a href="#i_130">Fig. 176</a>, allowing the catch to pass freely; and the pawl before it
begins to be lifted returns to the original position, shown in <a href="#i_130">Fig.
177</a>, where it locks the catch J, and prevents any risk of its becoming
unhooked either in raising or lowering the tool in the well.</p>

<p>The boring tool shown in <a href="#i_127a">Figs. 163, 164</a>, which was employed for boring
a well of 19 inches diameter, weighs <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> ton, and is liberated by
reaction, by the arrangement shown in <a href="#i_128">Figs. 170 to 173</a>; and the same
mode of liberation was applied in the first instance to the larger
tool, shown in <a href="#i_127a">Figs. 166 to 169</a>, employed in sinking a well of 47 in.
diameter at Butte-aux-Cailles. The great weight of the latter tool,
however, amounting to as much as 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tons, necessitated so violent
a shock for the purpose of liberating the tool by reaction, that the
boring rods and the rest of the apparatus would have been damaged by a
continuance of that mode of working; and M. Dru was therefore led to
design the arrangement of the disengaging rod for releasing the tool,
as shown in <a href="#i_130">Figs. 174, 175</a>. In this case the cross-guide G fixed upon
the tool is made with an eye for the disengaging rod M to work through
freely. For borings of small diameter, however, the disengaging rod
cannot supersede the reaction system of liberation, as the latter alone
is able to work in borings as small as 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inches diameter; and a
bore-hole no larger than this diameter has been successfully completed
by M. Dru with the reaction tool to a depth of 750 feet.</p>

<p>The boring rods employed are of two kinds, wrought-iron and wood.
The wood rods seen in Figs. <a href="#i_126">159</a>, <a href="#i_132a">179</a>, are used for borings of large
diameter, as they possess the advantage of having a larger section for
stiffness without increasing the weight; and also when immersed in
water the greater portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> their weight is floated. The wood for
the rods requires to be carefully selected, and care has to be taken
to choose the timber from the thick part of the tree, and not the
toppings. In France, Lorraine, or Vosges, deals are preferred.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_132a" id="i_132a"></a>

<img src="images/i_132b.jpg" alt="" width="121" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Figs. 180-182.</p>
</div>

<p>The boring rods, whether of wood or iron, are screwed together either
by solid sockets, as in <a href="#i_132b">Fig. 181</a>, or with separate collars, as in
<a href="#i_132b">Figs. 180, 182</a>. The separate collars are preferred for the purpose, on
account of being easy to forge; and also because, as only one half of
the collar works in coupling and uncoupling the rods, while the other
half is fixed, the screw-thread becomes worn only at one end, and by
changing the collar, end for end, a new thread is obtained when one is
worn out, the worn end being then jammed fast as the fixed end of the
collar.</p>

<p>The boring rod is guided in the lower part of the hole by a lantern R,
<a href="#i_126">Fig. 159</a>, shown to a larger scale in <a href="#i_132a">Fig. 179</a>, which consists of four
vertical iron bars curved in at both ends, where they are secured by
movable sockets upon the boring rod, and fixed by a nut at the top. By
changing the bars, the size of the lantern is readily adjusted to any
required diameter of bore-hole, as indicated by the dotted lines. In
raising up or letting down the boring rod, two lengths of about 30 feet
each are detached or added at once, and a few shorter rods of different
lengths are used to make up the exact length required. The coupling
screw S, <a href="#i_125">Fig. 158</a>, by which the boring rod is connected to the working
beam B, serves to complete the adjustment of length; this is turned by
a cross-bar, and then secured by a cross-pin through the screw.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 184.</p>
</div>

<p>In ordinary work, breakages of the boring rod generally take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> place in
the iron, and more particularly at the part screwed, as that is the
weakest part. In the case of breakages, the tools usually employed for
picking up the broken ends are a conical screwed socket, shown in <a href="#i_133a">Fig.
183</a>, and a crow&#8217;s foot, shown in <a href="#i_133b">Fig. 184</a>; the socket being made with
an ordinary V-thread for cases where the breakage occurs in the iron;
but having a sharper thread, like a wood screw, when used where the
breakage is in one of the wood rods. In order to ascertain the shape of
the fractured end left in the bore-hole, and its position relatively to
the centre line of the hole, a similar conical socket is first lowered,
having its under surface filled up level with wax, so as to take an
impression of the broken end, and show what size of screwed socket
should be employed for getting it up. Tools with nippers are sometimes
used in large borings, as it is not advisable to subject the rods to a
twist.</p>

<p>When the boring tool has detached a sufficient quantity of material,
the boring rod and tool are drawn up by means of the rope O, <a href="#i_125">Fig. 158</a>,
winding upon the drum Q, which is driven by straps and gearing from
the steam-engine T. A shell is then lowered into the bore-hole by the
wire-rope U, from the other drum V, and is afterwards drawn up again
with the excavated material. A friction break is applied to the drum
Q, for regulating the rate of lowering the boring rod down the well.
The shell shown in <a href="#i_133c">Figs. 186, 187</a>, consists of a riveted iron cylinder,
with a handle at the top, which can either be screwed to the boring
rod or attached to the wire-rope; and the bottom is closed by a large
valve, opening inwards. Two different forms of valve are used, either
a pair of flap-valves, as shown in <a href="#i_133c">Fig. 186</a>, or a single-cone valve,
<a href="#i_133c">Fig. 187</a>; and the bottom ring of the cylinder, forming the seating of
the valve, is forged solid, and steeled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> the lower edge. On lowering
this cylinder to the bottom of the bore-hole, the valve opens, and the
loose material enters the cylinder, where it is retained by the closing
of the valve, whilst the shell is drawn up again to the surface. In
boring through chalk, as in the case of the deep wells in the Paris
basin, the hole is first made of about half the final diameter for 60
to 90 feet depth, and it is then enlarged to the full diameter by using
a larger tool. This is done for convenience of working; for if the
whole area were acted upon at once, it would involve crushing all the
flints in the chalk; but, by putting a shell in the advanced hole, the
flints that are detached during the working of the second larger tool
are received in the shell and removed by it, without getting broken by
the tool.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_133c" id="i_133c"></a>

<p class="caption">Figs. 185-187.</p>
</div>

<p>The resistance experienced in boring through different strata is
various; and some rocks passed through are so hard, that with 12,000
blows a day of a boring tool weighing nearly 10 cwt., with 19 inches
height of fall, the bore-hole was advanced only 3 to 4 inches a day.
As the opposite case, strata of running sand have been met with so
wet, that a slight movement of the rod at the bottom of the hole was
sufficient to make the sand rise 30 to 40 feet in the bore-hole. In
these cases Dru has adopted the Chinese method of effecting a speedy
clearance, by means of a shell closed by a large ball-clack at the
bottom, as shown in <a href="#i_133c">Fig. 186</a>, and suspended by a rope, to which a
vertical movement is given; each time the shell falls upon the sand a
portion of this is forced up into the cylinder, and retained there by
the ball-valve.</p>

<p>Borings of large diameter, for mines or other shafts, are also sunk
by means of the same description of boring tools, only considerably
increased in size, extending up to as much as 14 feet diameter. The
well is then lined with cast-iron or wrought-iron tubing, for the
purpose of making it water-tight; and a special contrivance, invented
by Kind, and alluded to at p. <a href="#Page_110">110</a>, has been adopted for making a
water-tight joint between the tubing and the bottom of the well, or
with another portion of tubing previously lowered down. This is done
by a stuffing-box, shown in <a href="#i_135">Fig. 188</a>, which contains a packing of
moss at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> A A. The upper portion of the tubing is drawn down to the
lower portion by the tightening screws B B, so as to compress the
moss-packing when the weight is not sufficient for the purpose. A space
C is left between the tubing and the side of the well, to admit of the
passage of the stuffing-box flange, and also for running in concrete
for the completion of the operation. The moss-packing rests upon the
bottom flange D; but this flange is sometimes omitted. The joint is
thus simply made by pressing out the moss-packing against the sides of
the well; and this material, being easily compressible and not liable
to decay under water, is found to make a very satisfactory and durable
joint.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_135" id="i_135"></a>

</div>

<p>M. Dru states that the reaction tool has been successfully employed
for borings up to as large as about 4 feet diameter, witness the case
of the well at Butte-aux-Cailles of 47 inches diameter; but beyond
that size he considers the shock requisite to liberate the larger and
heavier tool would probably be so excessive, as to be injurious to the
boring rods and the rest of the attachments; and he therefore designed
the arrangement of the disengaging rod for liberating the tool in
borings of large diameter, whereby all shock upon the boring rods was
avoided and the tool was liberated with complete certainty.</p>

<p>In practice it is necessary, as with the common chisel, to turn the
boring tool partly round between each stroke, so as to prevent it from
falling every time in the same position at the bottom of the well; and
this was effected in the well at Butte-aux-Cailles by manual power at
the top of the well, by means of a long hand-lever fixed to the boring
rod by a clip bolted on, which was turned round by a couple of men
through part of a revolution during the time that the tool was being
lifted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> turning was ordinarily done in the right-hand direction
only, so as to avoid the risk of unscrewing any of the screwed
couplings of the boring rods; and care was taken to give the boring
rod half a turn when the tool was at the bottom, so as to tighten the
screw-couplings, which otherwise might shake loose. In the event of a
fracture, however, leaving a considerable length of boring rod in the
hole, it was sometimes necessary to have the means of unscrewing the
couplings of the portion left in the hole, so as to raise it in parts
instead of all at once. In that case a locking clip was added at each
screwed joint above, and secured by bolts, as shown at C in <a href="#i_132b">Fig. 180</a>,
at the time of putting the rods together for lowering them down the
well to recover the broken portion; and by this means the ends of the
rods were prevented from becoming unscrewed in the coupling sockets,
when the rods were turned round backwards for unscrewing the joints in
the broken length at the bottom of the bore-hole.</p>

<p>When running sands are met with, the plan adopted is to use the Chinese
ball-scoop, or shell, <a href="#i_133c">Fig. 186</a>, described for clearing the bottom of
the bore-hole; and where there is too much sand for it to be got rid of
in this way, a tube has to be sent down from the surface to shut off
the sand. This, of course, necessitates diminishing the diameter of
the hole in passing through the sand; but on reaching the solid rock
below the running sand, an expanding tool is used for continuing the
bore-hole below the tubing with the same diameter as above it, so as to
allow the tubing to go down with the hole.</p>

<p>In the case of meeting with a surface of very hard rock at a
considerable inclination to the bore-hole, M. Dru employs a tool, the
cutters of which are fixed in a circle all round the edge of the tool,
instead of in a single diameter line; the length of the tool is also
considerably increased in such cases, as compared with the tools used
for ordinary work, so that it is guided for a length of as much as 20
feet. He uses this tool in all cases where from any cause the hole is
found to be going crooked, and has even succeeded by this means in
straightening a hole that had previously been bored crooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>The cutting action of this tool is all round its edge; and therefore in
meeting with an inclined hard surface, as there is nothing to cut on
the lower side, the force of the blow is brought to bear on the upper
side alone, until an entrance is effected into the hard rock in a true
straight line with the upper part of the hole.</p>

<p>Although as regards diameter, depth, and flow of water in favourable
localities, some extraordinary results have been obtained with this
system of boring by rods worked by steam power, yet, as Dru himself
observes, &#8220;in some instances his own experience of boring had been,
that owing to the difficulties attending the operation, the occurrence
of delays from accidents was the rule, while the regular working of
the machinery was the exception.&#8221; A further disadvantage to be noticed
is that, owing to the time and labour involved in raising and lowering
heavy rods in borings of 10 inches diameter and upwards, there is a
strong inducement to keep the boring tool at work for a much longer
period than is actually necessary for breaking-up fresh material at
each stroke. The fact is that after from 100 to 200 blows have been
given, the boring tool merely falls into the accumulated <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and
pounds this into dust, without again touching the surface of the solid
rock. It may therefore be easily understood how much time is totally
lost out of the periods of five to eight hours during which with the
rod system the tool is allowed to continue working.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mather and Platt&#8217;s System.</span></h3>

<p>In the most recent method of boring adopted in England, the rope
employed in the Chinese system has been reverted to, in place of
the iron or wood rods used on the Continent. A flexible rope admits
of being handled with greater facility than iron rods, but wants
the advantage of rigidity: in the Chinese method it admitted of
withdrawing the chisel or bucket very rapidly, but gave no certainty
to the operation of the chisel at the bottom of the hole. The rods
on the other hand enable a very effective blow to be given, with a
definite turning or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> screwing motion between the blows according to
the requirements of the strata; but the time and trouble of raising
heavy rods from great depths on each occasion of changing from boring
to clearing out the hole form a serious drawback, which makes the
stoppages occupy really a longer time than the actual working of the
machinery.</p>

<p>The method invented by Colin Mather, and manufactured by Mather and
Platt, of Oldham, employed largely in England for deep boring, seems
to combine the advantages of the systems hitherto used, and to be
free from many of their disadvantages. The distinctive features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of this plan, which is shown in Figs. <a href="#i_138">189</a> to <a href="#i_144">195</a>, are the mode of
giving the percussive action to the boring tool, and the construction
of the tool or boring-head, and of the shell-pump

 for clearing out the hole after the action
of the boring-head. Instead of these implements being attached to rods,
they are suspended by a flat hemp-rope, about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick and 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches broad, such as is commonly used at collieries; and the boring
tool and shell-pump are raised and lowered as quickly in the bore-hole
as the bucket and cages in a colliery shaft.</p>

is wound upon a large drum C driven by a steam-engine D with a

greatest ease. All the working parts are fitted into a wood or iron
framing E E, rendering the whole a compact and complete machine. On
leaving the drum C the rope passes under a guide pulley F, and then
over a large pulley G carried in a fork at the top of the piston-rod of
a vertical single-acting steam cylinder.</p>

<i>Large Boring Machine.</i><br />

</div>

<p>This cylinder, by which the percussive action of the boring-head is
produced, is shown to a larger scale in the vertical sections, <a href="#i_140">Figs.
192</a>, <a href="#i_142">193</a>; and in the larger size of machine here shown, the cylinder is
fitted with a piston of 15 inches diameter, having a heavy cast-iron
rod 7 inches square, which is made with a fork at the top carrying the
flanged pulley G of about 3 feet diameter and of sufficient breadth for
the flat rope A to pass over it. The boring-head having been lowered
by the winding drum to the bottom of the bore-hole, the rope is fixed
secure at that length by the clamp J; steam is then admitted underneath
the piston in the cylinder H by the steam valve K, and the boring tool
is lifted by the ascent of the piston-rod and pulley G; and on arriving
at the top of the stroke the exhaust valve L is opened for the steam
to escape, allowing the piston-rod and carrying pulley to fall freely
with the boring tool, which falls with its full weight to the bottom
of the bore-hole. The exhaust port is 6 inches above the bottom of the
cylinder, while the steam port is situated at the bottom; and there is
thus always an elastic cushion of steam retained in the cylinder of
that thickness for the piston to fall upon, preventing the piston from
striking the bottom of the cylinder. The steam and exhaust valves are
worked with a self-acting motion by the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> tappets M M, which are actuated by the
movement of the piston-rod; and a rapid succession of blows is thus
given by the boring tool on the bottom of the bore-hole. As it is
necessary that motion should be given to the piston before the valves
can be acted upon, a small jet of steam N is allowed to be constantly
blowing into the bottom of the cylinder; this causes the piston to move
slowly at first, so as to take up the slack of the rope and allow it
to receive the weight of the boring-head gradually and without a jerk.
An arm attached to the piston-rod then comes in contact with a tappet
which opens the steam valve K, and the piston rises quickly to the top
of the stroke; another tappet worked by the same arm then shuts off the
steam, and the exhaust valve L is opened by a corresponding arrangement
on the opposite side of the piston-rod, as shown in <a href="#i_142">Fig. 193</a>. By
shifting these tappets the length of stroke of the piston can be varied
from 1 to 8 feet in the large machine, according to the material to be
bored through; and the height of fall of the boring-head at the bottom
of the bore-hole is double the length of stroke of the piston. The fall
of the boring-head and piston can also be regulated by a weighted valve
on the exhaust pipe, checking the escape of the steam, so as to cause
the descent to take place slowly or quickly, as may be desired.</p>

<p>The boring-head B, <a href="#i_138">Fig. 189</a>, is shown to a larger scale in <a href="#i_144">Figs. 194,
195</a>, and consists of a wrought-iron bar about 4 inches diameter and 8
feet long, to the bottom of which a cast-iron cylindrical block C is
secured. This block has numerous square holes through it, into which
the chisels or cutters D D are inserted with taper shanks, as shown in
Fig. 195, so as to be very firm when working, but to be readily taken
out for repairing and sharpening. Two different arrangements of the
cutters are shown in the elevation, <a href="#i_144">Fig. 194</a>, and the plan, <a href="#i_144">Fig. 196</a>.
A little above the block C another cylindrical casting E is fixed upon
the bar B, which acts simply as a guide to keep the bar perpendicular.
Higher still is fixed a second guide F, but on the circumference of
this are secured cast-iron plates made with ribs of a saw-tooth or
ratchet shape, catching only in one direction; these ribs are placed at
an inclination like segments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of a screw-thread of very long pitch, so that as the guide bears
against the rough sides of the bore-hole when the bar is raised or
lowered they assist in turning it, for causing the cutters to strike in
a fresh place at each stroke. Each alternate plate has the projecting
ribs inclined in the opposite direction, so that one half of the ribs
are acting to turn the bar round in rising, and the other half to turn
it in the same direction in falling. These projecting spiral ribs
simply assist in turning the bar, and immediately above the upper guide
F is the arrangement by which the definite rotation is secured. To
effect this object two cast-iron collars, G and H, are cottered fast
to the top of the bar B, and placed about 12 inches apart; the upper
face of the lower collar G is formed with deep ratchet-teeth of about
2 inches pitch, and the under face of the top collar H is formed with
similar ratchet-teeth, set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> exactly in line with those on the lower
collar. Between these collars and sliding freely on the neck of the
boring bar B is a deep bush J, which is also formed with corresponding
ratchet-teeth on both its upper and lower faces; but the teeth on the
upper face are set half a tooth in advance of those on the lower face,
so that the perpendicular side of each tooth on the upper face of the
bush is directly above the centre of the inclined side of a tooth on
the lower face. To this bush is attached the wrought-iron bow K, by
which the whole boring bar is suspended with a hook and shackle O, <a href="#i_140">Fig.
192</a>, from the end of the flat rope A. The rotary motion of the bar is
obtained as follows: when the boring tool falls and strikes the blow,
the lifting bush J, which during the lifting has been engaged with
the ratchet-teeth of the top collar H, falls upon those of the bottom
collar G, and thereby receives a twist backwards through the space
of half a tooth; and on commencing to lift again, the bush rising up
against the ratchet-teeth of the top collar H receives a further twist
backwards through half a tooth. The flat rope is thus twisted backwards
to the extent of one tooth of the ratchet; and during the lifting
of the tool it untwists itself again, thereby rotating the boring
tool forwards through that extent of twist between each successive
blow of the tool. The amount of the rotation may be varied by making
the ratchet-teeth of coarser or finer pitch. The motion is entirely
self-acting, and the rotary movement of the boring tool is ensured with
mechanical accuracy. This simple and most effective action taking place
at every blow of the tool produces a constant change in the position of
the cutters, thus increasing their effect in breaking the rock.</p>

</div>

<p>The shell-pump, for raising the material broken up by the boring-head,
is shown in <a href="#i_146">Figs. 197, 198</a>, and consists of a cylindrical shell or
barrel P of cast-iron, about 8 feet long and a little smaller in
diameter than the size of the bore-hole. At the bottom is a clack A
opening upwards, somewhat similar to that in ordinary pumps; but its
seating, instead of being fastened to the cylinder P, is in an annular
frame C, which is held up against the bottom of the cylinder by a rod D
passing up to a wrought-iron bridge E at the top, where it is secured
by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> cotter F. Inside the cylinder works a bucket
B, similar to that of a common lift-pump, having an indiarubber disc
valve on the top side; and the rod D of the bottom clack passes freely
through the bucket. The rod G of the bucket itself is formed like a
long link in a chain, and by this link the pump is suspended from
the shackle O, <a href="#i_140">Fig. 192</a>, at the end of the flat rope, the bridge E,
<a href="#i_146">Fig. 197</a>, preventing the bucket from being drawn out of the cylinder.
The bottom clack A is made with an indiarubber disc, which opens
sufficiently to allow the water and smaller particles of stone to enter
the cylinder; and in order to enable the pieces of broken rock to be
brought up as large as possible, the entire clack is free to rise
bodily about 6 inches from the annular frame C, as shown in <a href="#i_146">Fig. 197</a>,
thereby affording ample space for large pieces of rock to enter the
cylinder, when drawn in by the up stroke of the bucket.</p>

<p>The general working of the boring machine is as follows. The winding
drum C, <a href="#i_138">Fig. 189</a>, is 10 feet diameter in the large machine, and is
capable of holding 3000 feet length of rope 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches broad and
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inch thick. When the boring-head B is hooked on the shackle at
the end of the rope A, its weight pulls round the drum and winding
engine, and by means of a break it is lowered steadily to the bottom
of the bore-hole; the rope is then secured at that length by screwing
up tight the clamp J. The small steam jet N, Figs. <a href="#i_140">192</a>, <a href="#i_142">193</a>, is next
turned on, for starting the working of the percussion cylinder H; and
the boring-head is then kept continuously at work until it has broken
up a sufficient quantity of material at the bottom of the bore-hole.
The clamp J which grips the rope is made with a slide and screw I, <a href="#i_140">Fig.
192</a>, whereby more rope can be gradually given out as the boring-head
penetrates deeper in the hole. In order to increase the lift of the
boring-head, or to compensate for the elastic stretching of the rope,
which is found to amount to 1 inch in each 100 feet length, it is
simply necessary to raise the top pair of tappets on the tappet rods
whilst the percussive motion is in operation. When the boring-head
has been kept at work long enough, the steam is shut off from the
percussion cylinder, the rope unclamped, the winding engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> put in
motion, and the boring-head wound up to the surface, where it is then
slung from an overhead suspension bar Q, <a href="#i_138">Fig. 189</a>, by means of a hook
mounted on a roller for running the boring-head away to one side, clear
of the bore-hole.</p>

<p>The shell-pump is next lowered down the bore-hole by the rope, and the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> pumped into it by lowering and raising the bucket about three
times at the bottom of the hole, which is readily effected by means of
the reversing motion of the winding engine. The pump is then brought up
to the surface, and emptied by the following very simple arrangement:
it is slung by a traversing hook from the overhead suspension bar Q,
<a href="#i_138">Fig. 189</a>, and is brought perpendicularly over a small table E in the
waste tank T; and the table is raised by the screw S until it receives
the weight of the pump. The cotter F, <a href="#i_146">Fig. 197</a>, which holds up the
clack seating C at the bottom of the pump, is then knocked out; and the
table being lowered by the screw, the whole clack seating C descends
with it, as shown in <a href="#i_146">Fig. 198</a>, and the contents of the pump are washed
out by the rush of water contained in the pump cylinder. The table is
then raised again by the screw, replacing the clack seating in its
proper position, in which it is secured by driving the cotter F into
the slot at the top; and the pump is again ready to be lowered down
the bore-hole as before. It is sometimes necessary for the pump to be
emptied and lowered three or four times in order to remove all the
material that has been broken up by the boring-head at one operation.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which these operations may be carried on is found
in the experience of the working of the machine to be as follows. The
boring-head is lowered at the rate of 500 feet a minute. The percussive
motion gives twenty-four blows a minute; this rate of working continued
for about ten minutes in red sandstone and similar strata is sufficient
for enabling the cutters to penetrate about 6 inches depth, when the
boring-head is wound up again at the rate of 300 feet a minute. The
shell-pump is lowered and raised at the same speeds, but only remains
down about two minutes; and the emptying of the pump when drawn up
occupies about two or three minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In the construction of this machine it will be seen that the great
desideratum of all earth boring has been well kept in view; namely,
to bore-holes of large diameter to great depths with rapidity and
safety. The object is to keep either the boring-head or the shell-pump
constantly at work at the bottom of the bore-hole, where the actual
work has to be done; to lose as little time as possible in raising,
lowering, and changing the tools; to expedite all the operations at the
surface; and to economize manual labour in every particular. With this
machine, one man standing on a platform at the side of the percussion
cylinder performs all the operations of raising and lowering by the
winding engine, changing the boring-head and shell-pump, regulating the
percussive action, and clamping or unclamping the rope: all the handles
for the various steam valves are close to his hand, and the break for
lowering is worked by his foot. Two labourers attend to changing the
cutters and clearing the pump. Duplicate boring-heads and pumps are
slung to the overhead suspension bar Q, <a href="#i_138">Fig. 189</a>, ready for use, thus
avoiding all delay when any change is requisite.</p>

<p>As is well known by those who have charge of such operations, in
well boring innumerable accidents and stoppages occur from causes
which cannot be prevented, with however much vigilance and skill
the operations may be conducted. Hard and soft strata intermingled,
highly-inclined rocks, running sands, and fissures and dislocations
are fruitful sources of annoyance and delay, and sometimes of complete
failure; and it will therefore be interesting to notice a few of the
ordinary difficulties arising out of these circumstances. In all the
bore-holes yet executed by this system, the various special instruments
used under any circumstances of accident or complicated strata are
fully shown in Figs. <a href="#i_150">199</a> to <a href="#i_151">207</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_151" id="i_151"></a>

<p class="caption">Figs. 205-207.</p>
</div>

<p>The boring-head while at work may suddenly be jammed fast, either by
breaking into a fissure, or in consequence of broken rock falling upon
it from loose strata above. All the strain possible is then put upon
the rope, either by the percussion cylinder or by the winding engine;
and if the rope is an old one or rotten it breaks, leaving perhaps a
long length in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
hole. The claw grapnel, shown in <a href="#i_150">Fig. 199</a>, is then attached to the
rope remaining on the winding drum, and is lowered until it rests
upon the slack broken rope in the bore-hole. The grapnel is made
with three claws A A centred in a cylindrical block B, which slides
vertically within the casing C, the tail ends of the claws fitting into
inclined slots D in the casing. During the lowering of the grapnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the claws are kept open, in consequence of the trigger E being held up
in the position shown in <a href="#i_150">Fig. 199</a>, by the long link F, which suspends
the grapnel from the top rope. But as soon as the grapnel rests upon
the broken rope below, the suspending link F continuing to descend
allows the trigger E to fall out of it; and then in hauling up again,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> grapnel is lifted only by the bow G of the internal block B, and
the entire weight of the external casing C bears upon the inclined
tail ends of the claws A, causing them to close in tight upon the
broken rope and lay hold of it securely. The claws are made either
hooked at the extremity or serrated. The grapnel is then hauled up
sufficiently to pull the broken rope tight, and wrought-iron rods 1
inch square with hooks attached at the bottom are let down to catch the
bow of the boring-head, which is readily accomplished. Two powerful
screw-jacks are applied to the rods at the surface, by means of the
step-ladder shown in <a href="#i_150">Fig. 201</a>, in which the cross-pin H is inserted at
any pair of the holes, so as to suit the height of the screw-jacks.</p>

<p>If the boring-head does not yield quickly to these efforts, the
attempt to recover it is abandoned, and it is got out of the way by
being broken up into pieces. For this purpose the broken rope in the
bore-hole has first to be removed, and it is therefore caught hold
of with a sharp hook and pulled tight in the hole, while the cutting
grapnel, shown in <a href="#i_150">Fig. 200</a>, is slipped over it and lowered by the rods
to the bottom. This tool is made with a pair of sharp cutting jaws or
knives I I opening upwards, which in lowering pass down freely over the
rope; but when the rods are pulled up with considerable force, the jaws
nipping the rope between them cut it through, and it is thus removed
altogether from the bore-hole. The solid wrought-iron breaking-up bar,
<a href="#i_150">Fig. 203</a>, which weighs about a ton, is then lowered, and by means of
the percussion cylinder it is made to pound away at the boring-head,
until the latter is either driven out of the way into one side of the
bore-hole, or broken up into such fragments as that, partly by the
shell-pump and partly by the grapnels, the whole obstacle is removed.
The boring is then proceeded with again, the same as before the
accident.</p>

<p>The same mishap may occur with the shell-pump getting jammed fast
in the bore-hole, as illustrated in <a href="#i_153">Fig. 208</a>; and the same means of
removing the obstacle are then adopted. Experience has shown the
danger of putting any greater strain upon the rope than the percussion
cylinder can exert; and it is therefore usual to lower the grapnel rods
at once, if the boring-head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> or pump gets fast, thus avoiding the risk
of breaking the rope.</p>

<i>Shell-pump<br />

</div>

<p>The breaking of a cutter in the boring-head is not an uncommon
occurrence. If, however, the bucket grapnel, or the small screw
grapnel, <a href="#i_150">Fig. 202</a>, be employed for its recovery, the hole is readily
cleared without any important delay. The screw grapnel, <a href="#i_150">Fig. 202</a>, is
applied by means of the iron grappling rods, so that by turning the
rods the screw works itself round the cutter or other similar article
in the bore-hole, and securely holds it while the rods are drawn up
again to the surface. The bucket grapnel, <a href="#i_151">Fig. 206</a>, is also employed
for raising clay, as well as for the purpose of bringing up cores
out of the bore-hole, where these are not raised by the boring-head
itself in the manner already described. The action of this grapnel is
nearly similar to that of the claw grapnel, <a href="#i_150">Fig. 199</a>; the three jaws A
A, hinged to the bottom of the cylindrical casing C, and attached by
connecting rods to the internal block B sliding within the casing C,
are kept open during the lowering of the tool, the trigger E being held
up in the position shown in <a href="#i_151">Fig. 206</a>, by the long suspending link F. On
reaching the bottom, the trigger is liberated by the further descent
of the link F, which, in hauling up again, lifts only the bow G of the
internal block B; so that the jaws A are made to close inwards upon the
core, which is thus grasped firmly between them and brought up within
the grapnel. Where there is clay or similar material at the bottom of
the bore-hole, the weight of the heavy block B in the grapnel causes
the sharp edges of the pointed jaws to penetrate to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> depth into
the material, a quantity of which is thus enclosed within them and
brought up.</p>

<p>Another grapnel that is also used where a bore-hole passes through
a bed of very stiff clay is shown in <a href="#i_151">Fig. 207</a>, and consists of a
long cast-iron cylinder H fitted with a sheet-iron mouthpiece K at
the bottom, in which are hinged three conical steel jaws J J opening
upwards. The weight of the tool forces it down into the clay with
the jaws open; and then on raising it the jaws, having a tendency
to fall, cut into the clay and enclose a quantity of it inside the
mouthpiece, which on being brought up to the surface is detached from
the cylinder H and cleaned out. A second mouthpiece is put on and sent
down for working in the bore-hole while the first is being emptied, the
attachment of the mouthpiece to the cylinder being made by a common
bayonet-joint L, so as to admit of readily connecting and disconnecting
it.</p>

</div>

<p>A running sand in soft clay is, however, the most serious difficulty
met with in well boring. Under such circumstances the bore-hole has to
be tubed from top to bottom, which greatly increases the expense of the
undertaking, not only by the cost of the tubes, but also by the time
and labour expended in inserting them. When a permanent water supply
is the main object of the boring, the additional expense of tubing
the bore-hole is not of much consequence, as the tubed hole is more
durable, and the surface water is thereby excluded; but in exploring
for mineral it is a serious matter, as the final result of the
bore-hole is then by no means certain. The mode of inserting tubes has
become a question of great importance in connection with this system of
boring, and much time and thought having been spent in perfecting the
method now adopted, its value has been proved by the repeated success
with which it has been carried out.</p>

<p>The tubes used by Mather and Platt are of cast-iron, varying in
thickness from <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> to 1 inch according to their diameter, and are all
9 feet in length. The successive lengths are connected together by
means of wrought-iron covering hoops 9 inches long, made of the same
outside diameter as the tube, so as to be flush with it. These hoops
are from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch thick, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> ends of each tube are reduced
in diameter by turning down for 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches from the end, to fit
inside the hoops, as shown in <a href="#i_155">Fig. 209</a>. A hoop is shrunk fast on one
end of each tube, leaving 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches of socket projecting to receive
the end of the next tube to be connected. Four or six rows of screws
with countersunk heads, placed at equal distances round the hoop, are
screwed through into the tubes to couple the two lengths securely
together. Thus a flush joint is obtained both inside and outside the
tubes. The lowest tube is provided at the bottom with a steel shoe,
having a sharp edge for penetrating the ground more readily.</p>

<p>In small borings, from 6 to 12 inches diameter, the tubes are
inserted into the bore-hole by means of screw-jacks, by the simple
and inexpensive method shown in <a href="#i_156">Figs. 210, 211</a>. The boring machine
foundation A A, which is of timber, is weighted at B B by stones, pig
iron, or any available material; and two screw-jacks C C, each of
about 10 tons power, are secured with the screws downwards, underneath
the beams D D crossing the shallow well E, which is always excavated
at the top of the bore-hole. A tube F having been lowered into the
mouth of the bore-hole by the winding engine, a pair of deep clamps G
are screwed tightly round it, and the screw-jacks acting upon these
clamps force the tube down into the ground. The boring is then resumed,
and as it proceeds the jacks are occasionally worked, so as to force
the tube if possible even ahead of the boring tool. The clamps are
then slackened and shifted up the tubes, to suit the length of the
screws of the jacks; two men work the jacks, and couple the lengths of
tubes as they are successively added. The actual boring is carried on
simultaneously within the tubes, and is not in the least impeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> by
their insertion, which simply involves the labour of an additional man
or two.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>A more perfect and powerful tube-forcing apparatus is adopted where
tubes of from 18 to 24 inches diameter have to be inserted to a great
depth, an illustration of which is afforded by an extensive piece of
work at the Horse Fort, standing in the channel at Gosport. This fort
is a huge round tower, as shown in <a href="#i_157">Fig. 212</a>; and to supply the garrison
with fresh water, a bore-hole is sunk into the chalk. A cast-iron well
A, consisting of cylinders 6 feet diameter and 5 feet long, has been
sunk 90 feet into the bed of the channel in the centre of the fort, and
from the bottom of this well an 18-inch bore-hole B is now in progress.
The present depth is 400 feet, and the bore-hole is tubed the whole
distance with cast-iron tubes 1 inch thick, coupled as before described.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_157" id="i_157"></a>

<p class="caption">Fig. 213.</p>
</div>

<p>The method of inserting these tubes is shown in <a href="#i_158">Fig. 213</a>. Two
wrought-iron columns C C, 6 inches diameter, are firmly secured in the
position shown, by castings bolted to the flanges of the cylinders A
A forming the well, so that the two columns are perfectly rigid and
parallel to each other. A casting D, carrying on its under side two
5-inch hydraulic rams I I of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> 4 feet length, is formed so as to slide
freely between the columns, which act as guides; the hole in the centre
of this casting is large enough to pass a bore-tube freely through it,
and by means of cotters passed through the slots in the columns the
casting is securely fixed at any height. A second casting E, exactly
the same shape as the top one, is placed upon the top of the tubes B B
to be forced down, a loose wrought-iron hoop being first put upon the
shoulder at the top of the tube, large enough to prevent the casting E
from sliding down the outside of the tubes; this casting or crosshead
rests unsecured on the top of the tube and is free to move with it. The
hydraulic cylinders I, with their rams pushed home, are lowered upon
the crosshead E, and the top casting D to which they are attached is
then secured firmly to the columns C by cottering through the slots.
A small pipe F, having a long telescope joint, connects the hydraulic
cylinders I with the pumps at the surface which supply the hydraulic
pressure. By this arrangement a force of 3 tons on the square inch, or
about 120 tons total upon the two rams, has frequently been exerted to
force down the tubes at the Horse Fort. After the rams have made their
full stroke of about 3 feet 6 inches, the pressure is let off, and
the hydraulic cylinders I with the top casting D slide down the rams
resting on the crosshead E, until the rams are again pushed home. The
top casting D is then fixed in its new position upon the columns C, by
cottering fast as before, and the hydraulic pressure is again applied;
and this is repeated until the length of two tubes, making 18 feet,
has been forced down. The whole hydraulic apparatus is then drawn up
again to the top, another 18 feet of tubing added, and the operation of
forcing down resumed. The tubes are steadied by guides at G and H, <a href="#i_158">Fig.
213</a>, shown also in the plans.</p>

<p>The boring operations are carried on uninterruptedly during the process
of tubing, excepting only for a few minutes when fresh tubes are being
added. It will be seen that the cast-iron well is in this case the
ultimate abutment against which the pressure is exerted in forcing the
tubes down, instead of the weight of the boring machine with stones and
pig iron added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> as in the case where the screw-jacks are used; the
hydraulic method was designed specially for the work at Gosport, and
has acted most perfectly. Both the cast-iron well and the bore-hole
are entirely shut off from all percolation of sea-water, by first
filling up the well 30 feet with clay round the tubes, and making the
tubes themselves water-tight at the joints at the time of putting them
together.</p>

<p>In the event of any accident occurring to the tubes while they are
being forced down the bore-hole, such as requires them to be drawn up
again out of the hole, the prong grapnel, <a href="#i_150">Fig. 204</a>, is employed for the
purpose, having three expanding hooked prongs, which slide down readily
inside the tube, and spring open on reaching the bottom; the hooks
then project underneath the edge of the tube, which is thus raised on
hauling up the grapnel. In case the tubes get disjointed and become
crooked during the process of tubing, the long straightening plug, <a href="#i_151">Fig.
205</a>, consisting of a stout piece of timber faced with wrought-iron
strips, is lowered down inside them; above this is a heavy cast-iron
block, the weight of which forces the plug past the part where the
tubes have got displaced, and thereby straightens them again.</p>

<p>Although there are few localities where the geological formation is
not favourable to the yield of pure water if a boring be carried deep
enough, yet it rarely happens that free-flowing wells such as those
in Paris and Hull are the result. Generally after the water-bearing
strata have been pierced, the level to which the water will rise is
at some depth below the surface of the ground; and only by the aid
of pumps can the desired supply be brought to the surface. Various
pumping arrangements have therefore been adopted to suit the different
conditions that are met with.</p>

<p>It is not the object of the present work to treat of the forms and
fittings of pumps, and the following details are only given as
completing Mather and Platt&#8217;s system.</p>

<p>It is always desirable to sink a cast-iron well, such as that at the
Horse Fort, as nearly as possible down to the level at which the water
stands in the bore-hole. The sinking of such a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> is rendered an
easy and rapid operation, with the aid of the boring machine in winding
out the material from the bottom, and keeping the sinkers dry by the
use of the dip-bucket, shown in <a href="#i_161">Figs. 214 to 216</a>, which will lift
from 50 to 100 gallons of water a minute, for taking off the surface
drainage. A well having thus been made down to the level of the water
in the bore-hole, the permanent pumps are then applied to the bore-hole
as follows, the size of the pumps varying according to the diameter of
the bore-hole. Taking the case of a 15-inch bore-hole, a pump barrel
consisting of a plain cast-iron cylinder, say 12 inches diameter and 12
feet long, as shown in section in <a href="#i_162">Fig. 219</a>, is attached at the bottom
of cast-iron or copper pipes, which are <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> inch larger in diameter
than the pump barrel, and are coupled together in lengths by flanges,
<a href="#i_161">Fig. 217</a>. By adding the requisite number of lengths of pipe at the top,
the pump barrel is lowered to any desired depth down the bore-hole: the
nearer to the depth of the water-bearing strata the better. The topmost
length of pipe has a broad flange at its upper end, which rests upon a
preparation made to receive it on the cast-iron bottom of the well, as
at C in <a href="#i_162">Fig. 219</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_161" id="i_161"></a>

<p class="caption">Figs. 214-218.</p>
</div>

<p>A pump bucket D, <a href="#i_162">Fig. 219</a>, with a water passage through it and a clack
on the top side, is then lowered into the barrel, being suspended by a
solid wrought-iron pump-rod E, which is made up of lengths of 30 feet
coupled together by right-and-left-hand screw-couplings, as in <a href="#i_161">Fig.
218</a>. A second bucket F<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of similar form is also lowered into the pump barrel, above the first
bucket, and is suspended by hollow rods G coupled together in the
manner just described; the inside diameter of the hollow rods G being
such that the couplings of the solid rods E may pass freely through.
The pump-rods are carried up the well A to the surface, where the
hollow rod of the top bucket is attached to the horizontal arm of a
bell-crank lever H, <a href="#i_162">Fig. 219</a>; and the solid rod of the bottom bucket,
passing up through the hollow rod of the top bucket, is suspended from
the horizontal arm of a second reversed bell-crank lever K, facing the
first lever H. As the extremities of the horizontal arms of the levers
meet over the centre of the well, one of them is made with a forked end
to admit of the other passing it. The vertical arms of the two levers
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> coupled by a connecting rod L, and a reciprocating motion is given
to them by means of an oscillating steam cylinder M, the piston-rod
of which is attached direct to the extremity of one of the vertical
arms; a crank and flywheel N are also connected to the levers, for
controlling the motion at the ends of the stroke. With the proportion
shown in the <a href="#i_162">Figure</a> of 3 to 4 between the horizontal and vertical arms
of the bell-crank levers, the stroke of 5 feet 4 inches of the steam
piston gives 4 feet stroke of the pump. The reciprocating motion of
the reversed bell-crank levers causes the two buckets to move always
in opposite directions, so that they meet and separate at each stroke
of the engine. A continuous flow of water is the result, for when the
top bucket is descending, the bottom bucket is rising and delivering
its water through the top bucket; and when the top bucket rises, it
lifts the water above it while the bottom bucket is descending, and
water rises through the descending bottom bucket to fill the space left
between the two buckets. In this way the effect of a double-acting pump
is produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_162" id="i_162"></a>
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" alt="" width="346" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 219.</p>
</div>

<p>Although a continuous delivery of water is thus obtained of equal
amount in each stroke, it is found in practice that a heavy shock
is occasioned at each end of the stroke, in consequence of both the
buckets starting and stopping simultaneously, causing the whole column
of water to be stopped and put into motion again at each stroke. As an
air-vessel for keeping up the motion of the water is inapplicable in
such a situation, a modified arrangement of the two bell-crank levers
has been adopted, which answers the purpose, causing each bucket at the
commencement of its up stroke to take the lift off the other, before
the up stroke of the latter is completed. By this means all shock is
avoided, as the first bucket gently and gradually relieves the second,
before the return stroke of the second commences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In this improved pumping motion, which is shown in <a href="#i_164tb">Figs. 220, 221</a>, the
two bell-crank levers H and K, working the pump buckets, are centred
one above the other, the upper one being inverted; the vertical arms
are slotted, and are both actuated by the same crank-pin working in the
slots, the revolution of the crank thus giving an oscillating movement
to the two levers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> through the extent of the arcs shown by the
dotted lines in <a href="#i_164tb">Fig. 220</a>. The solid pump-rod E suspending the bottom
bucket D is attached to the upper bell-crank lever K, and the hollow
rod G of the top bucket is suspended from the lower lever H; the
crank-shaft J working the levers is made to revolve in the direction
shown by the arrow in <a href="#i_164tb">Fig. 220</a>, by means of gearing driven by the
horizontal steam-engine P.</p>

<p>The result of this arrangement is, that in the revolution of the crank
the dead point of one of the levers is passed before that of the other
is reached; so that the bucket which first comes to rest at the end of
its stroke is started into motion again before the second bucket comes
to rest. Thus in the lifting stroke of the bottom bucket worked by the
upper lever K, the bucket in ascending has only reached the position
shown at D in <a href="#i_164tb">Fig. 220</a>, at the moment when the top bucket worked by
the lower lever H arrives at the bottom extremity of its stroke, and
the bottom bucket D, which is still rising, continues to lift until it
reaches its highest position, by which time the top bucket has got well
into motion in its up stroke, and is in its turn lifting the water.</p>

<span class="small">EXAMPLES OF WELLS EXECUTED, AND OF DISTRICTS SUPPLIED BY WELLS.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Permian Strata.</span></h3>

<p><i>Durham.</i>&mdash;Large quantities of water are pumped from the lower Permian
sandstone beneath the magnesian limestone of this county, and are used
for the supply of the towns of Sunderland, South Shields, Jarrow,
and many villages. The quantity, calculated by Daglish and Foster to
reach five millions of gallons a day, is obtained from an area of
fifty square miles overlying the coal measures. The water-level has
not been lowered in the rock by these operations. Along the coast it
is that of mean tide, and inland rises to a level of 180 feet. In the
coal measures below there is little water, and that little is saline.
Sedgwick gives the strata as red gypseous marls, 100 feet; thin bedded
grey limestone, 80 feet; red gypseous marls, slightly salt, 200
feet; magnesian limestone, 500 feet; marl slate, 60 feet; lower red
sandstone, 200 feet.</p>

<p><i>Coventry.</i>&mdash;Warwickshire. The town is supplied with 750,000 gallons of
water a day from two bore-holes made in the bottom of the reservoir.
The bore-holes are respectively 6 inches and 8 inches diameter, and 200
feet and 300 feet deep. The town is situated on the Permian formation,
but Latham states that the supply is procured from the red sandstone,
and, from observations made, it has been found that the two bore-holes
yield water at the rate of 700 gallons a minute.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Trias Strata.</span></h3>

<p><i>Birkenhead.</i>&mdash;There are here several deep wells belonging to the
Tranmere Local Board, the Birkenhead Commissioners, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> the Wirral
Water Company, yielding together about 4,000,000 gallons a day. <a href="#i_168tb">Figs.
222, 223</a>, show a section and plan of the No. 2 or new engine well at
the Birkenhead Waterworks. The shaft is 7 feet diameter for 105 feet,
with a bore-hole 26 inches for 35 feet, 18 inches for 16 feet, 12
inches for 99 feet, and 7 inches for 150 feet, or a total depth from
surface of 405 feet. The water-level is about 95 feet from surface
when the engine is not at work. At the upper water-level, shown in
the 26-inch hole, the yield was at the rate of 1,807,400 gallons in
twenty-four hours, at the lower level at the rate of 2,000,000 gallons
in the same time. At the water-level indicated in the 7-inch bore,
water was met with in large quantities. The old engine well is almost
identical.</p>

<p><a href="#i_168tb">Figs. 224, 225</a>, are a section and plan, and <a href="#i_168tb">Fig. 226</a> enlarged parts
of the well at Aspinall&#8217;s brewery, Birkenhead. It consists of a
shallow shaft 5 feet in diameter and steined, continued by means of
iron cylinders 3 feet 3 inches in diameter and 50 feet in depth. When
sand with much water of poor quality was met with, a series of lining
tubes was introduced from the point A A, the space between these and
the cylinders being filled with concrete. The tubes were discontinued
at the sandstone, and the lowest portion of the hole, 3 inches in
diameter, is unlined. The water overflows.</p>

<p><a href="#i_170tb">Figs. 227, 228</a>, are a section and plan of the well at Cook&#8217;s brewery,
Birkenhead. The shaft is 6 feet diameter, lined with 9-inch steining,
and is 66 feet deep. At 29 feet from surface it is enlarged for the
purpose of affording increased storage room for the water. There is a
16-inch pipe at bottom of shaft 49 feet deep, continued by a 12-inch
bore-hole 13 feet into the red sandstone. The water-level is 27 feet
from the surface of the ground.</p>

<p><i>Birmingham.</i>&mdash;Out of the 7,000,000 gallons a day supplied to the town
in 1865 by the Waterworks Company, 2,000,000 were derived from wells
in the new red sandstone. In that year an Act was passed authorizing
the sinking of several new wells, whereby the quantity may be greatly
increased.</p>

<p><i>Burton-on-Trent.</i>&mdash;<a href="#i_170tb">Fig. 229</a> is a section of the well at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
London and Colonial Brewery. Extraordinary precautions were taken in
constructing this well to obtain the water from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> lower strata
perfectly free from admixture with that from above. There is a steined
shaft within which is an iron cylinder, and this again is lined with
brick steining backed with concrete. The bore-hole, 182 feet deep and
4 inches diameter, is lined throughout with copper tubes. At the top
the bore-hole is surrounded with a short tube upon which a thread is
cut, so that, if necessary, a pipe may be screwed on and up to surface.
The water rises to within 6 feet 3 inches of the level of the ground.
<a href="#i_170tb">Fig. 230</a> is an enlarged section of the arrangements at the top of the
bore-hole, and <a href="#i_170tb">Fig. 231</a> an enlarged section of the pipe joints.</p>

<p><i>Crewe.</i>&mdash;Cheshire. A very plentiful supply of water for the supply of
the town and works of Crewe is obtained from a well sunk in the new red
sandstone. The water is said to be very pure, and from the analysis of
Dr. Zeidler it appears that there are only 6&#183;10 grains of solid matter
to the gallon.</p>

<p><i>Leamington.</i>&mdash;The well in this town is situated at the foot of Newbold
Hill, and is 5 feet in diameter and sunk to a depth of 50 feet. At
the bottom of the well a bore-hole, part of the way 18 inches and the
remainder 12 inches in diameter, is carried down 200 feet. It passes
through alternating beds of marl and sandstone, and the surface water
met with has been bricked or puddled out. The yield is about 320,000
gallons in twenty-four hours. Previously to this well being made, a
trial boring, of which <a href="#i_172tb">Figs. 232, 233</a>, are sections, was made. This
boring was lined with iron tubes 9 inches in diameter for 17 feet,
inside this 8 inches in diameter for 22 feet 9 inches, and within this
again a 5-inch tube. It was continued by a 5-inch bore reduced to 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches, and at bottom to 3 inches.</p>

<p><i>Liverpool.</i>&mdash;The oldest wells are at Bootle, to the north of the town;
these consisted in the first instance of three lodges or excavations
in the rock, covering about 10,000 feet super and about 26<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> feet
deep. These were covered with timber or slate roofs, and in them 16
bore-holes were sunk, of various diameters and at depths ranging from
13 feet to 600 feet. In 1850 the yield of one of these bore-holes was
921,192 gallons in twenty-four hours, and the total yield in the same
time only 1,102,065.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>The water was collected in the
lodges and conveyed by a tunnel 255 feet to a well 8 feet in diameter
and 50 feet deep, from which it was pumped. The yield of the Bootle
well in 1865 was 643,678 gallons a day. Since this time a new well of
oval form, 12 feet by 9 feet and 108 feet deep, has been sunk, and at
its completion the yield rose to 1,575,000 gallons a day, but it has
again diminished considerably.</p>

<p>The Green Lane wells were commenced in 1845, the surface being 144
feet above the sea-level and their depth 185 feet, or 41 feet below
the sea-level. Headings extend in all about 300 feet from the shafts
in various directions, three separate shafts being carried up to the
surface. At first the yield was 1,250,000 gallons a day. A bore-hole,
6 inches in diameter, was then driven to a depth of 60 feet from the
bottom of the well, when the yield increased to 2,317,000 gallons. In
June, 1856, the bore-hole was widened to 9 inches and carried down 101
feet farther, when the yield amounted to its present supply of over
3,000,000 gallons a day.</p>

<p>The large quantity of water yielded by the Green Lane well is probably
due to the existence of a large fault which is considered to pass in a
north-westerly direction by the well. In 1869 a bore-hole, 24 inches in
diameter at the top and diminishing to 18 inches in diameter, was sunk
from the bottom of a new shaft, 174 feet deep, to a depth of 310 feet,
and the additional quantity of water derived from the new hole was
about 800,000 gallons a day.</p>

<p>The Windsor Station well is of oval form, 12 feet by 10 feet and 210
feet deep, with a length of headings of 594 feet, and a bore-hole 4
inches in diameter and 245 feet deep. The yield is 980,000 gallons a
day.</p>

<p>The Dudlow Lane well is also oval, 12 feet by 9 feet, and is sunk to a
depth of 247 feet from the surface of the ground. Headings have been
driven from the bottom of the well for a total distance of 213 feet,
and an 18-inch bore-hole has been sunk to a depth of 196 feet from
the bottom of the well, which is chiefly in a close hard rock, with
occasional white beds from which the water is mainly obtained. The
yield is nearly 1,500,000 gallons a day.</p>

41,000,000 gallons, and there are also a great number of private wells
drawing water from the sandstone, and their supply may be roughly

<span class="smcap">Plan of Wells at Longton.</span></p>
</div>

<p><i>Longton</i>, Staffordshire.&mdash;The Potteries obtain a portion of their
supply from a series of wells at Longton, which are shown in the
diagrammatic sectional plan, <a href="#i_173">Fig. 234</a>. The well marked No. 1 is 12 feet
in diameter, and 135 feet deep in the new red sandstone. When finished
the water rose to within 35 feet from the surface. The cost of the
first 45 feet was 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a yard; of the second 45 feet, 6<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> a yard; and the third 45 feet, 9<i>l.</i> a yard. When this well was
36 feet down, a large quantity of water was met with, so a heading
was driven at that depth in the direction of No. 2 well; this, after
30 feet, passed through a fault which drained off the water, and the
sinking of No. 1 was proceeded with. After the engine had been erected
and pumping some short time, it was proposed to drive headings from the
bottom; but owing to the pumps taking up so much room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> the shaft,
there was not space enough for sinking operations to be carried on,
and No. 2 well was therefore sunk for convenience sake, at the cost of
about 30<i>s.</i> a yard. When No. 2 was down 54 feet, a trial bore-hole
3 inches diameter was put down, and water rose in a jet about 3 feet
high. The well was then continued to the level of No. 1, and a heading,
39 feet long, driven between the two shafts. No. 2 has now a 12-inch
bore-hole at bottom, down 54 feet.</p>

<p>Headings have also been driven W. and N. of No. 2 well, at a cost of
30<i>s.</i> a yard. The western heading is 213 feet long, driven with a
slight rise, and gave much water. There are two headings N., running in
the direction of the railway, one over the other. The lower was driven
level with the bottom of the shaft, but no water met with; the upper is
36 feet from the surface, and is intended to carry away surplus water
down to a line of earthenware pipes which are led along the railway to
a low-level reservoir.</p>

<p>In the eastern heading there is a rise of 4 feet, owing to the nature
of the strata; and after it had been driven 510 feet, well No. 3 was
sunk for ventilation and for drawing out material. A bed of very hard
sandstone, 63 feet long, was passed, cost 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a yard, and
beyond came marl, in which driving cost 45<i>s.</i> a yard. This heading
was continued 330 feet beyond No. 3, and an air-hole 3 inches diameter
put down 126 yards deep, but no water was met with. The bed of hard
sandstone was also found in driving the lower N. heading, which was
discontinued after going into it some 5 or 6 feet. The yield from these
wells is about 600,000 gallons a day, and recently a new bore-hole
at No. 3 well, when down 350 feet, gave some 380,000 gallons a day
additional.</p>

<p><i>Leek.</i>&mdash;The Potteries waterworks have also wells at the Wallgrange
Springs, near Leek; these rise from the conglomerate beds, and are
stated to yield 3,000,000 gallons daily. The water from these springs
is pumped into Ladderidge reservoir, and is distributed from thence
into the town of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Potteries.</p>

of a well at the works of Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, Middlesborough,
made under the direction of S. C. Homersham, C.E. A trial hole was
first put down to a depth of 398 feet 6 inches, and a shaft afterwards
sunk by Messrs. Docwra and Son to that depth, through alternating beds
of clay, sand, gypsum, and sandstone. At the bottom of the shaft a
bore-hole of 18 inches diameter throughout was made with Mather and
Platt&#8217;s apparatus to a depth of 1312 feet; the first 1160 feet of which
were through new red sandstone interspersed with beds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> of clay, white
sandstone, red marl, and gypsum. Next came 40 feet of gypsum, hard
white sandstone, and limestone; and the remaining 100 feet were through
red sandstone, pure salt rock, occasional layers of limestone, and then
salt rock to the bottom. The gross time spent in sinking this bore-hole
was 510 days, or an average of 2 feet 5 inches a day.</p>

<p><i>Ross</i>, Herefordshire.&mdash;The well at the Alton Court Brewery is shown
in <a href="#i_177tb">Figs. 239, 240</a>. The shaft, 5 feet in diameter and 27 feet deep, is
steined with 9-inch brickwork for a distance of 17<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> feet. At the bottom
is a 12-inch bore-hole 100 feet 9 inches deep, unlined. The water is
abundant. At level of the bore a heading, 6 feet high, 5 feet wide, and
27 long, has been driven, to afford storage room.</p>

<p><i>Wolverhampton.</i>&mdash;This town is partially supplied from wells sunk in
the new red sandstone. There are two shafts, 7 feet in diameter and 300
feet deep, a heading 459 feet long, and in this a boring of 390 feet.
The yield when first completed was 211,000 gallons a day.</p>

<p><i>St. Helens</i>, Lancashire.&mdash;Supplied with about 570,000 gallons daily
from two wells, each 210 feet deep, in the new red sandstone. Each well
has a bore-hole at the bottom.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oolitic Strata.</span></h3>

<p><i>Northampton.</i>&mdash;The well at the waterworks is sunk and bored 253 feet
3 inches in the lias. The shaft is steined with brickwork and iron
cylinders in the following order: for 16 feet 9 inches in depth the
well is 7 feet 6 inches in diameter, lined with brickwork; at this
depth two cast-iron cylinders 5 feet 6 inches diameter are introduced,
which are again succeeded by 9-inch brickwork, commencing at 5 feet
6 inches internal diameter and widening out to 7 feet 6 inches in
diameter. The bottom of the shaft is floored with bricks at a distance
of 120 feet from surface. At this point the bore-hole commences, and
for the first 31 feet it is lined with 14-inch pipes, which rise
into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> shaft 5 feet above the floor. The remaining portion of the
bore-hole, 102 feet, is 9 inches diameter.</p>

<p><i>Swanage</i>, Dorset.&mdash;The section and plan, <a href="#i_178tb">Figs. 241, 242</a>, are of a well
at Swanage, sunk 60 feet and bored 53 feet, the lining tube rising
8 feet into the shaft, which is 5 feet 6 inches in diameter, and
lined with 9-inch steining. The strata passed through are clays and
limestones, and may perhaps be referred to the Purbeck beds. At first
this well yielded little or no water, but it now gives a sufficient
supply.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cretaceous Strata.</span></h3>

<p><i>Bishop Stortford.</i>&mdash;The waterworks and well are situate west of the
town, near the farm buildings known as Marsh Barns. The shaft is 160
feet deep, the bore-hole 140 feet. The following is a section of the

<p>The level of the ground is 140 feet above the sea-level; water stands
29 feet deep; yield about 11,500 gallons an hour.</p>

<p><i>Brighton.</i>&mdash;This town has always been supplied from wells sunk in the
chalk. One well is sunk near the Lewes Road, and has a total length of
2400 feet of headings driven in a direction parallel with the sea, and
at about the coast-level of low water. These headings intercept many
fissures and materially add to the yield.</p>

<p>A second well was sunk in 1865, at Goldstone Bottom, and headings
driven to the extent of about a quarter of a mile across the valley
parallel to the sea.</p>

<p>Goldstone Bottom is a naturally formed basin in the chalk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> the lowest
side of which, nearest the sea, is more than 60 feet higher than the
middle or bottom of the basin. The water is obtained as at Lewes Road,
from fissures running generally at right-angles to the coast-line,
but they are of much larger size and at far greater distances from
each other; whereas at the Lewes Road well it is rare that 30 feet of
headings were driven without finding a fissure, and the yield of the
largest was not more than 100 to 150 gallons a minute. At Goldstone
nearly 160 feet were traversed without any result, and then an enormous
fissure was pierced which yielded at once nearly 1000 gallons a minute;
and the same interval was found between this and the next fissure,
which was of a capacity nearly as large. The total length of the
headings at Goldstone Bottom is 13,000 feet. The yield from each well
is about 3,000,000 gallons daily.</p>

<p><i>Chelmsford.</i>&mdash;The well belonging to the Local Board of Health,
situated at Moulsham, yields about 95,000 gallons of water a day. It
is sunk for 200 feet; the rest bored. Water overflowed at first, but
now that the well is in use and pumped from, the water only rises to 76
feet from the surface. The following strata were pierced;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cheshunt, New River Company.</i>&mdash;Situate at the engine-house between the
two reservoirs. The well is 171 feet deep, and is steined partly with
brickwork and partly with iron cylinders. For 12 feet in depth the well
is 11 feet 6 inches in diameter, and steined with 14-inch brickwork;
for a farther depth of 44 feet it is 9 feet diameter, and steined with
9-inch brickwork; of the 44 feet, 41 feet are lined with cast-iron
cylinders, 8 feet diameter, which are also carried to a depth of 105
feet from the surface. There are fifteen cylinders of this size in use,
and they are succeeded by others 6 feet 10 inches diameter, of which
there are six in use; these are again succeeded by two cylinders 6 feet
diameter. The whole of the cylinders are 6 feet in depth. The bottom
of the last cylinder is 118 feet from the surface, at which point they
rest upon a foundation of 9-inch brick steining 7 feet in depth. At the
bottom of the 6-feet cylinders the well widens out in the form of a
cone 12 feet 6 inches diameter at the floor, which is 26 feet below the
bottom of the 6-feet cylinder. In the centre of the well a bore-hole, 3
inches diameter and 27 feet deep, was made, and the well is provided on
the floor-level with headings.</p>

<p><i>Kentish Town.</i>&mdash;This well was sunk under the supposition that as
the outcrop of the subcretaceous formations was continuous around
the margin of the cretaceous basin surrounding and underlying the
London tertiaries, except at the eastern border, those subcretaceous
formations would be found under London, just as they actually were at
Paris. This proved to be the case until the gault was passed, when a
series of sandstones and clays was encountered, occupying the place of
the lower greensand, but evidently of older geological character, and
having many of the features of the new red sandstone.</p>

borer passed through hard chalk with flints at distances of about 6 or
7 feet apart, for 700 feet, with the exception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>of 10 feet at the depth of 500 feet where
the rock was soft and of a rusty colour, thence the flints were
thicker, namely, about 4 feet apart to the depth of 1050 feet. After
this 102 feet were pierced of chalk, free from flints, to the upper
greensand, a stratum of about 6 feet, and then gault for 36 feet. The
whole boring being full of water to within 16 feet of the surface.</p>

<p>For boring these wells special tools had to be used, which have already
been described at length in Chap. VI.</p>

<p>A large Artesian well was, in 1867, being constructed by Dru at
Butte-aux-Cailles, <a href="#i_192tb">Fig. 255</a>, for the supply of the city of Paris, which
is intended to be carried down through the greensand to a depth of 2600
or 2900 feet to reach the Portland limestone. The boring in 1867 was
490 feet deep, and its diameter 47 inches.</p>

<p>During the previous 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> years, M. Dru was engaged in sinking a
similar well of 19 inches diameter for supplying the Sugar Refinery of
M. Say, in Paris, <a href="#i_192tb">Fig. 255</a>; 1570 feet deep of this well had been bored
in 1867, see <a href="#i_192tb">Fig. 258</a>.</p>

<p>The well at Grenelle was sunk by Mulot in 1832, and after more than
eight years&#8217; incessant labour, water rose on the 26th of February,
1842, from the total depth of 1806 feet 9 inches. The diameter of the
bore-hole is 8 inches, ending, as is seen in the detail sections, Figs.
<a href="#i_193">259</a> to <a href="#i_194">262</a>, in the lower greensand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>The well of Passy was intended to be executed in the Paris basin which
it was to traverse with a diameter, hitherto unattempted, of 1 m&egrave;tre
(3&#183;2809 feet); that of the Grenelle well being only 20 centim&egrave;tres
(8 inches). It was calculated that it would reach the water-bearing
stratum at nearly the same depth as the latter, and would yield 8000
m&egrave;tres or 10,000 cubic m&egrave;tres in twenty-four hours, or about 1,786,240
gallons to 2,232,800 gallons a day.</p>

<p>The operations were undertaken by Kind under a contract with the
Municipality of Paris, by which he bound himself to complete the works
within the space of twelve months from the date of their commencement,
and to deliver the above quantity of water for the sum of 300,000
francs, 12,000<i>l</i>. On the 31st of May, 1857&mdash;after the workmen had been
engaged nearly the time stipulated for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> the completion of the work,
and when the boring had been advanced to the depth of 1732 feet from
the surface&mdash;the excavation suddenly collapsed in the upper strata, at
about 100 feet from the ground, and filled up the bore. Kind would have
been ruined had the engineers of the town held him to the strict letter
of his contract; but it was decided to behave in a liberal manner,
and to release him from it, the town retaining his services for the
completion of the well, as also the right to use his patent machinery.
The difficulties encountered in carrying the excavation through the
clays of the upper strata were found to be so serious that, under the
new arrangement, it required six years and nine months of continuous
efforts to reach the water-bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>stratum, of which time the far larger portion was employed
in traversing the clay beds. The upper part of this well was finally
lined with solid masonry, to the depth of 150 feet from the surface;
and beyond that depth tubing of wood and iron was
introduced. This tubing was continued to the depth of 1804 feet from
the surface, and had at the bottom a length of copper pipe pierced with
holes to allow the water to enter. At this depth the compound tubing
could not be made to descend any lower; but the engineers employed by
the city of Paris were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> convinced that they could obtain the water by
means of a preliminary boring; and therefore they proceeded to sink in
the interior of the above tube of 3.2809 feet diameter, an inner tube 2
feet 4 inches diameter, formed of wrought-iron plates 2 inches thick,
so as to enable them to traverse the clays encountered at this zone. At
last, the water-bearing strata were met with on the 24th of September,
1861, at the depth of 1913 feet 10 inches from the ground-line; the
yield of the well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
being, at the first stroke of the tool that pierced the crust, 15,000
cubic m&egrave;tres in 24 hours, or 3,349,200 gallons a day; it quickly rose
to 25,000 cubic m&egrave;tres, or 5,582,000 gallons a day; and as long as the
column of water rose without any sensible diminution, it continued to
deliver a uniform quantity of 17,000 m&egrave;tres, or 3,795,000 gallons a
day. The total cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> of this well was more than 40,000<i>l.</i>, instead of
12,000<i>l.</i>, at which Kind had originally estimated it.</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether the engineers of the town were justified
in passing the contract with Kind to finish the work within the time,
and for the sum at which he undertook it; but they certainly treated
him with kindness and consideration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> in allowing him to conduct the
work at the expense of the city of Paris, for so long a period after
the expiration of his contract. It seems, however, that the French
well-borers could not at the time have attempted to continue the well
upon any other system than that introduced by Kind; that is to say,
upon the supposition that it should be completed of the dimensions
originally undertaken. Experience has shown that both steining and
tubing were badly executed at the well of Passy. The masonry lining
was introduced after Kind&#8217;s contract had expired, and when he had
ceased to have the control of the works; the wrought-iron tubing at the
lower part of the excavation being a subsequent idea. It has followed
from this defective system of tubing&mdash;the wood necessarily yielding
in the vertical joints&mdash;that the water in its upward passage escaped
through the joints, and went to supply the basement beds of the Paris
basin, which are as much resorted to as the London sand-beds for an
Artesian supply; and, in fact, the level of the water has been raised
in the neighbouring wells by the quantity let in from below, and the
yield of the well itself has been proportionally diminished, until it
has fallen to 450,000 gallons a day. That the increased yield of the
neighbouring wells is to be accounted for by the escape of the water
from the Artesian boring is additionally proved by the temperature of
the water in them; it is found to be nearly 82&deg; Fah., or nearly that
observed in the water of Passy. This was an unfortunate complication
of the bargain made between Kind and the Municipal Council; but it in
no respect affects the choice of the boring machinery, which seems to
have complied with all the conditions it was designed to meet. The
descent of the tubes and their nature ought to have been the subject of
special study by the engineers of the town, who should have known the
nature of the strata to be traversed better than Kind could be supposed
to do, and should have insisted upon the tubing being executed of cast
or wrought-iron, so as effectually to resist the passage of the water.
At any rate, this precaution ought to have been taken in the portions
of the well carried through the basement beds of the Paris basin, or
through the lower members of the chalk and the upper greensand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><i>Ponders End</i>, Middlesex.&mdash;At the works of the London Jute Company. It
will be seen from the <a href="#i_198tb">Figs. 267, 268</a>, that this well is bored all but
the top 4 feet, which is 5 feet across and steined with 9-inch work.
The uppermost tube is 12 inches in diameter, decreased to 9 inches, and
then to 8 inches, and ending with a 6-inch bore, unlined, in the chalk.</p>

<p>Good bricks are characterized as being regular in shape, with plane
parallel surfaces, and sharp right-angles; clear ringing sound when
struck, a compact uniform structure when broken, and freedom from
air-bubbles and cracks. They should not absorb more than one-fifteenth
of their weight in water.</p>

<p>After making liberal allowance for waste, 9 bricks will build a square
foot 9 inches thick, or 900, 100 square feet, or say 2880 to the rood
of 9-inch work, which gives the simple rule of 80 bricks&nbsp;&#61;&nbsp;a square
yard of 9-inch work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>The resistance to crushing is from 1200 to 4500 lb. a square inch; the
resistance to fracture, from 600 to 2500 lb. a square inch; tensile
strength, 275 lb. a square inch; weight, in mortar, 175 lb. a cubic
foot; in cement, 125 lb. a cubic foot.</p>

<p>Compressed bricks are much heavier, and consequently proportionately
stronger, than those of ordinary make.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Storing Well-water</span>.</h3>

<p>The reservoirs for storing well-water should be covered with brick
arches, as the water is generally found to become rapidly impure on
being exposed to the sunlight, principally owing to the rapid growth
of vegetation. Various methods have been tried, such as keeping up a
constant current of fresh water through them, and a liberal use of
caustic lime; but so rapid is the growth of the vegetation, as well
as the change in the colour of the water, that a few hours of bright
sunlight may suffice to spoil several million gallons. These bad
results are completely prevented by covering the reservoirs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Hints on Superintending Well-work</span>.</h3>

<p>The engineer who has to superintend the construction of a well should
be ever on the watch to see whether, in the course of the work, the
strata become so modified as to overthrow conclusions previously
arrived at, and on account of which the well has been undertaken.</p>

<p>A journal of everything connected with the work should be carefully
made, and if this one point alone is attended to it will be found of
great service both for present and future reference.</p>

<p>Before commencing a well a wooden box should be provided, divided by a
number of partitions into small boxes; these serve to keep specimens
of the strata, which should be numbered consecutively and described
against corresponding numbers in the journal. At each change of
character in the strata, as well as every time the boring rods are
drawn to surface, the soil should be carefully examined, and at each
change a small quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> placed in one of the divisions of the core
box, noting the depth at which it was obtained, with other necessary
particulars. A note should be made of all the different water-levels
passed through, the height of the well above the river near which it
is situated, as well as its height above the sea. The memoranda in the
journal relating to accidents should be especially clear and distinct
in their details; it is necessary to describe the effects of each tool
used in the search for, or recovery of, broken tools in a bore-hole,
in order to suit the case with the proper appliances, for without
precaution we may seek for a tool indefinitely without being sure of
touching it, and perhaps aggravate the evil instead of remedying it. It
is by no means a bad plan to make rough notes of all immediate remarks
or impressions, in such a manner as to form a full and detailed account
of any incidents which occur either in raising or lowering the tools.
At the time of an accident a well kept journal is a precious resource,
and at a given moment all previous observations, trivial as they may
have often seemed, will form a valuable clue to explain difficulties,
without this aid perfectly inexplicable.</p>

<p>When an engineer has a certain latitude allowed him in the choice of
the position for a well, he should not, other things being equal,
neglect the advantages which will be derived from the proximity of a
road for the transport of his supplies; of a well, if not a brook, from
which to obtain the water necessary for the cleansing of the tools;
and of a neighbouring dwelling, to facilitate his active supervision.
This supervision, having often to be carried on both day and night,
should be the object of particular study; well carried out, it may be
effective, while at the same time allowing a great amount of liberty;
badly carried out, however fatiguing it may be, it will be incomplete.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rate of Progress of Boring</span>.<br />

(Andr&eacute;.)</h3>

<p>There are probably no engineering operations in which the rate of
progress is so variable as it is in that of boring. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> such must
necessarily be the case will be obvious when we bear in mind that the
strata composing the earth&#8217;s crust consist of very different materials;
that these materials are mingled in very different proportions, and
that they have in different parts been subjected to the action of very
different agencies operating with very different degrees of intensity.
Hence it arises not only that some kinds of rocks require a much longer
time to bore through than others, but also that the length of time may
vary in rocks of the same character, and that the character may change
within a short horizontal distance. Thus it is utterly impossible to
predicate concerning the length of time which a boring in an unknown
district may occupy, and only a rough approximation can be arrived
at in the case of localities whose geological constitution has been
generally determined. Such an approximation may, however, be attained
to, and it is useful in estimating the probable cost; and to attain the
same end, for unknown localities, an average may be taken of the time
required in districts of a similar geological character. The following,
which are given for this purpose, are the averages of a great number of
borings executed under various conditions by the ordinary methods. The
progress indicated represents that made in one day of eleven hours.</p>

<p>When the cost of materials and labour is known, that of the boring
may be approximately estimated from the above averages. Should hard
limestone or igneous rock be met with, the rate of progress may be less
than half the above general average. Below 100 yards, not only does the
rate of progress rapidly increase, but the material required diminishes
in like proportion, so that for superficial borings no surface
erections are needed, and the cost sinks to two or three shillings a
yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cost of Boring</span>.</h3>

<p>The cost of boring when executed by contract has already been treated
of at page 80. The following formula will furnish the same results as
the rule there given, but with the least possible labour of calculation;</p>

<p class="center">
<i>x</i> &#61; 0&#183;5<i>d</i>(&#183;187 + &#183;0187<i>d</i>);</p>
<p class="noindent"><i>x</i> being the sum sought, in pounds, and <i>d</i> the depth of the boring in
yards.</p>

<p><i>Example.</i> Let it be required to know the cost of a bore-hole 250 yards
deep.</p>

<p class="center">Here 125{&#183;187 &#43; (&#183;0187 &times; 250)} &#61; &pound;607&#183;75.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tempering Boring Chisels.</span></h3>

<p>1. Heat the chisel to a blood red heat, and then hammer it until nearly
cold; again, heat it to a blood red and quench as quickly as possible
in 3 gallons of water in which is dissolved 2 oz. of oil of vitriol, 2
oz. of soda, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> oz. of saltpetre, or 2 oz. of sal ammoniac, 2 oz.
of spirit of nitre, 1 oz. of oil of vitriol: the chisel to remain in
the liquor until it is cold.</p>

<p>2. To 3 gallons of water add 3 oz. of spirit of nitre, 3 oz. of spirits
of hartshorn, 3 oz. of white vitriol, 3 oz. sal ammoniac, 3 oz. alum,
6 oz. of salt, with a double handful of hoof-parings, the chisel to be
heated to a dark cherry red.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gases in Wells.</span></h3>

<p>The most abundant deleterious gas met with in wells is carbonic acid,
which extinguishes flame and is fatal to animal life. Carbonic acid
is most frequently met with in the chalk, where it has been found to
exist in greater quantity in the lower than in the upper portion of
the formation, and in that division to be unequally distributed. Fatal
effects from it at Epsom, 200 feet down, and in Norbury Park, near
Dorking, 400 feet down, have been recorded. At Bexley Heath, after
sinking through 140<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> feet of gravel and sand and 30 feet of chalk, it
rushed out and extinguished the candles of the workmen. Air mixed with
one-tenth of this gas will extinguish lights; it is very poisonous,
and when the atmosphere contains 8 per cent. or more there is danger
of suffocation. When present it is found most abundantly in the lower
parts of a well from its great specific gravity.</p>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen is also occasionally met with, and is supposed to
be generated from the decomposition of water and iron pyrites.</p>

<p>In districts in which the chalk is covered with sand and London clay,
carburetted hydrogen is occasionally emitted, but more frequently
sulphuretted hydrogen. Carburetted hydrogen seldom inflames in wells,
but in making the Thames Tunnel it sometimes issued in such abundance
as to explode by the lights and scorch the workmen. Sulphuretted
hydrogen also streamed out in the same place, but in no instance
with fatal effects. At Ash, near Farnham, a well was dug in sand to
the depth of 36 feet, and one of the workmen descending into it was
instantly suffocated. Fatal effects have also resulted elsewhere from
the accumulation of this gas in wells.</p>
